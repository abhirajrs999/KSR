Benkelman beam has been among the earliest equipment used for measuring deflection and structural evaluation of pavements. In this technique, a static load is applied to the pavement surface and rebound deflections are measured at one or more locations.

Benkelman beam has been among the earliest equipment used for measuring deflection and structural evaluation of pavements. In this technique, a static load is applied to the pavement surface and rebound deflections are measured at one or more locations. Measurement of deflection under a static load does not simulate the loading conditions produced in pavements by a moving vehicle.

Sub-sections of uniform performance should be identified for each traffic lane and shoulder separately. This will be useful for\n\n\n\nsampling 2 carriageway IRC:115-2014 1\nselecting the size for different portions of for conducting deflection measurements. Identification of fair separately for each lane and shoulder based on the corresponding distress maps.\n\n5.3.6 As it is inexpedient to change the sample size for deflection measurement at frequent intervals, it will be preferable if the length of each uniform section is kept at a minimum of km except the case = or other closer in of localised failures in situations requiring examination where minimum length of section should be 0.3 km from the consideration of profile correction and constructability.\n\n| Classification | Pavement Condition                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",

However, if in a particular situation a better estimate of the distribution of traffic between the carriageway lanes is available from traffic surveys, the same should be adopted and the design should be based on the traffic in the most heavily trafficked lane. The design will normally be applied over the whole carriageway width.\n\ni) Single-lane roads (3.75 m width)\n\nTraffic tends to be more channelized on single-lane roads than two-lane\n\n\n\nIRC:115-2014\n# 7.4.3 Vehicle Damage Factor\n\nThe Vehicle Damage Factor (VDF) is a multiplier for converting the number of commercial vehicles of different axle loads to equivalent number of standard axle load (80 kN) repetitions. It gives the equivalent number of standard axles per commercial vehicle. The vehicle damage factor is arrived at from axle load surveys conducted on typical road sections so as to cover various influencing factors such as traffic mix, type of transportation, type of commodities carried, time of t",

Hence, design overlay thickness is 95 mm of Bituminous Concrete with VG-30 binder.\n\n\n\nIRC:115-2014\n# Lane Position\n\n|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n| - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - |\n|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n\n# Bituminous Layer\n\n| Granular Layer   | Subgrade       |\n| ---------------- | -------------- |\n| Bituminous Layer | Granular Layer |\n| Subgrade         |                |\n\n\n",

The working principle of a typical FWD is illustrated in Fig. 1. DO, D1, etc., mentioned in Fig. 1 are surface deflections measured at different radial distances. Impulse load is applied by means of a falling mass, which is allowed to drop vertically on a system of springs placed over a circular loading plate. The deflected shape of the pavement surface is measured using displacement sensors which are placed at different radial distances starting from the center of the load plate. Trailer mounted as well as vehicle mounted FWD models are available commercially. The working principle of these models essentially is the same.

ELAYER computer program (Reddy, 1993), which uses linear elastic layered theory for the analysis of flexible pavements, was used as the forward calculation routine. It is recommended that the pavement be modeled as a three layer system. For this, layers with similar stiffness can be grouped together. Rough bonding interfaces are assumed between layers. KGPBACK, like most other backcalculation programs, does not backcalculate Poisson's ratio and thicknesses. Typical values of Poisson's ratio are selected as Poisson's values (when chosen range) for the analysis are not expected to have any significant influence on the deflections. Thicknesses must be from construction records, cores, non-destructive test data, or using techniques such as GPR.\n\n# 111.8.2 Length of Chromosome\n\nThe length of chromosome used to represent the variable is based on the required accuracy backcalculated. In KGPBACK, the length of chromosome was taken as the number of layers multiplied by 10, with each modulus being represented by a string of length 10.\n\n# 111.8.3 GA Parameters\n\nGA parameters such as population size, maximum number of generations and probabilities of crossover and mutation, are selected in an optimal way so the GA works satisfactorily for the given problem. Based on an extensive study conducted for the determination of optimal GA parameters for typical three layer pavement systems, the following GA parameters have been selected.\n\n29\n\nIRC:115-2014\n# Population Size\n\n60\n\n# Maximum Number of Generations\n\n60\n\n# Crossover Probability\n\n0.74\n\n# Mutation Pr",

Length of chromosome used to represent the variable based on the required accuracy backcalculated is of 3 values. Chromosome length of '10' for each layer modulus is generally adequate.\n\nThe GA parameters such as population, maximum number of generations, crossover and mutation are given as probabilities of inputs to the program. Objective function OBJ is calculated from the calculated and measured deflection values. OBJ is the sum of squares of the relative error deflections (difference between computed deflection and measured deflection divided by measured deflection) for all positions. The fitness of each solution set is evaluated using Equation:\n\nFitness = 1/1 + OBJ ... (III.1)\n\nThe solution with the best fitness obtained in different generations is stored as the final output (backcalculated moduli) along with the corresponding fitness values.\n\n# 111.8 Salient Features of KGPBACK\n\nKGPBACK uses linear elastic layered theory for the analysis of pavements in its forward calculation algorithm. ELAYER computer program (Reddy, 1993), which uses linear elastic layered theory for the analysis of flexible pavements, was used as the forward calculation routine. It is recommended that the pavement be modeled as a three layer system. For this, layers with similar stiffness can be grouped together. Rough bonding interfaces are assumed between layers. KGPBACK, like most other backcalculation programs, does not backcalculate Poisson's ratio and thicknesses. Typical values of Poisson's ratio are selected as Poisson's values (when chosen range) for the analysis are not expected to have any significant influence on the deflections. Thicknesses must be from construction records, cores, non-destructive test data, or using techniques such as GPR.\n\n# 111.8.2 Length of Chromosome\n\nThe length of chromosome used to represent the variable is based on the required accuracy backcalculated. In KGPBACK, the length of chromosome was taken as the number of layers multiplied by 10, with each modulus being represented by a string of length 10.\n\n# 111.8.3 GA Parameters\n\nGA parameters such as population size, maximum number of generations and probabilities of crossover and mutation, are selected in an optimal way so the GA works satisfactorily for the given problem. Based on an extensive study conducted for the determination of optimal GA parameters for typical three layer pavement systems, the following GA parameters have been selected.\n\n29\n\nIRC:115-2014\n# Population Size\n\n60\n\n# Maximum Number of Generations\n\n60\n\n# Crossover Probability\n\n0.74\n\n# Mutation Pr",

Tensile strain at the bottom of bituminous layer = 284.5 microstrains; Vertical strain on top of subgrade = 439.6 microstrains.\n\nRemaining pavement fatigue life obtained using Equation 16 is 11.07 msa whereas the remaining rutting life as obtained from Equation 17 is 233.7 msa. The existing pavement is inadequate to carry the design 100 msa traffic from fatigue consideration.\n\n# Selection of overlay thickness:\n\nThe combination of existing pavement and overlay will be analysed as a four-layer system to ensure that fatigue and rutting criteria are satisfied for the assumed design traffic. Trial overlay thicknesses are selected and maximum tensile strain at the bottom of the existing bituminous layer has been computed using the thicknesses and moduli of various layers inputs.\n\nAnalysis of the pavement with a Bituminous Concrete overlay (with VG-30 binder) of 95 mm thickness yields a tensile strain of 159.8 microstrain and 208.3 vertical subgrade strain. Elastic modulus value of BC mix has been taken as 1695 MPa.\n\nThe following inputs are considered for calculation of strains, tensile critical strain at the bottom of total bituminous layer and vertical strain on top of subgrade:\n\n| Layer thicknesses considered are:            | 95 mm    | 17",
