The technique of resealing of failed old joints has also been given in the document.\n\n# 3 GENERAL\n\n# 3.1\n\nCement concrete pavements (roads, streets, airport apron, taxi-ways and runways, etc) are subjected to volumetric changes (expansion and contraction) caused by changes in their moisture content and/or temperature which leads to initial drying, shrinkage and irreversible creep. These changes cause movements of slabs. If contraction movements are excessively restrained, they will result in cracking of the pavement. On the other hand, the restraint of expansion movements may result in development of compressive stresses that are borne by abutting faces of the slab. Transverse joints are provided to accommodate these movements and thereby prevent development of distress in the pavement. Longitudinal joints are provided to relieve stresses due to wrapping and dividing the pavement into convenient lanes. Joints are also required to facilitate construction.\n\n# 3.2\n\nDetails of different types of joints in concrete pavements are outlined in IRC:15, “Code of Practice for Construction of Jointed Plain Concrete Pavements”. The present standard is intended to augment the provisions contained in IRC:15.\n\n\n\nIRC:57-2018\n# 3.3\n\nThe introduction of joints creates openings in the slab which must be sealed in order to prevent ingress of rain water to the sub-base/subgrade or other unwanted substances, like, grit into the openings. Foreign solid matter which is incompressible must b",

These changes cause movements of slabs. If contraction movements are excessively restrained, they will result in cracking of the pavement. On the other hand, the restraint of expansion movements may result in development of compressive stresses that are borne by abutting faces of the slab. Transverse joints are provided to accommodate these movements and thereby prevent development of distress in the pavement.

They also relieve stresses due to wrapping.\n\nDetails of the contraction joints are given in IRC:15. They are formed initially by sawing a groove of 3-5 mm width up to about one-fourth to one-third the slab thickness as shown in Fig. 6. This facilitates the formation of a natural crack at this location extending to the full depth. In order to seal the joint, the top 10-20 mm of this groove is widened to 8-10 mm as shown in Figs. 3, 4 and 5. For heavy duty roads, these joints are provided with steel dowel bars to improve the continuity of slab and improved performance of joints, including load transfer. Typical cross-section of a contraction joint is given in Fig. 6(a).\n\nNote: Width of contraction joint play an important role to improve the riding quality. As good quality saw cutting machines are available, which can ensure very thin joint as low as 3 mm, low viscosity sealants with higher Movement Accommodation Factor (MAF), good pouring tools are also available and therefore contraction joints with sealing groove width of 6 mm resulting in lower maintenance cost and better riding quality are possible to be designed and constructed.\n\n# 5.3 Longitudinal Joints\n\nLongitudinal joints are provided in multi-lane pavements and also when the pavement is more than 4.0 m wide. They also relieve stresses due to wrapping. Initially joint is cut to a depth 1/4 to 1/3 of the slab. Tie bars are provided at the joints not for load transference but for keeping the adjoining slabs together. The details of such joints are given in IRC:15. The top 10-20 mm depth of the joint is sawn to a width of 6-8 mm for sealing. Typical cross-section of a joint is given in Fig. 6(b).\n\n# 5.4 Expansion Joints\n\nThese are full-depth butt joints provided transversely into which pavement can expand, thus relieving compressive stresses due to expansion of concrete slabs, and preventing any tendency towards distortion, buckling, blow-u",

The skid plate holds the concrete in place during cutting to minimize crumbling/raveling/dislodging of aggregates from the joint edges. The gap between the blade and the edge of the slot is extremely narrow. Over time, abrasion may cause widening of the slot and increases the chance for edge ravelling of the joint. Therefore, early-entry saw cutting requires replacement of skid plate each time the blade is replaced for maximum effectiveness.\n\n# 6.3 Paper-backed Debonding Strip\n\nBefore sealing, the temporary seal provided for blocking the ingress of dirt, soil, stone chips etc. shall be removed carefully. A debonding strip is then inserted in the groove to break the bond between the sealant and the bottom of the groove and to plug the groove so that the sealant may not leak through the initial groove and ultimately into the cracks. The details are given in Figs. 3, 4 and 5. The heat resistant debonding strips are required for those cases where hot poured sealant is used. In the case of compressible debonding strip to be used in contraction joint, normally the strip is provided with a paper-back so that sealant is not absorbed by the debonding strip. If the strip is non-absorbant type no paper-back is required.\n\nIRC:57-2018\n\nThe width of the debonding strip shall be more than the width of joint groove so that it is held tightly in the groove.\n\nIn the case of longitudinal joints there is no need to install compressible debonding strip but a debonding tape of 1.0-2.0 mm thickness is sufficient to plug the groove so that sealant does not flow downwards in the first cut groove.

The depth of cut shall be minimum 10 % of slab thickness subject to 30 mm minimum.\n\nEarly-entry saw cutting are dry-cuts so their blades are designed for use without water for cooling. They are also “up-cut” saws, meaning that the cutting edge of the blade moves upward during operation. This helps to push debris out of the joint. In addition, they have a skid plate, which slides on the concrete surface and has slot through which the saw blade is inserted. The skid plate holds the concrete in place during cutting to minimize crumbling/raveling/dislodging of aggregates from the joint edges. The gap between the blade and the edge of the slot is extremely narrow. Over time, abrasion may cause widening of the slot and increases the chance for edge ravelling of the joint. Therefore, early-entry saw cutting requires replacement of skid plate each time the blade is replaced for maximum effectiveness.\n\n# 6.3 Paper-backed Debonding Strip\n\nBefore sealing, the temporary seal provided for blocking the ingress of dirt, soil, stone chips etc. shall be removed carefully. A debonding strip is then inserted in the groove to break the bond between the sealant and the bottom of the groove and to plug the groove so that the sealant may not leak through the initial groove and ultimately into the cracks. The details are given in Figs. 3, 4 and 5. The heat resistant debonding strips are required for those cases where hot poured sealant is used. In the case of compressible debonding strip to be used in contraction joint, normally the strip is provided with a paper-back so that sealant is not absorbed by the debonding strip. If the strip is non-absorbant type no paper-back is required.\n\nIRC:57-2018\n\nThe width of the debonding strip shall be more than the width of joint groove so that it is held tightly in the groove.\n\nIn the case of longitudinal joints there is no need to install compressible debonding strip but a debonding tape of 1.0-2.0 mm thickness is sufficient to plug the groove so that sealant does not flow downwards in the first cut groove. Heat resistant debonding strip, however, is to be used when hot-po",

As this material gets affected by heat, this is used for cold-poured joints.\n- Cross linked polyethylene foam: This is compatible with hot-poured sealants. It is a closed-cell foam that does not absorb water and is moderately compressible, but will not melt in contact with hot-poured sealant.\n- Polyurethene foam: It is of open cell foam which can absorb moisture but does not get affected by hot-pour sealant.

The dams should be thereafter cut and replaced with sealant. In order to avoid spillage of sealant on the concrete surface card-board or tape should be stuck on both edges before pouring sealant.
