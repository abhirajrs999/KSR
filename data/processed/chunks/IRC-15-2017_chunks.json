Tie bars are not required for structural reasons, but their only function is to prevent separation of the slabs, especially at fills or curves. Tie bars are not designed to act as load transfer devices. Tie bars are designed to withstand tensile stresses only and provided at mid-depth.\n\n# 8.4.4\n\nTie bars projecting across the longitudinal joint shall be protected from corrosion for 75 mm on each side of the joint by a protective coating of bituminous paint. The coating shall be dry when the tie bars are used.\n\n# 8.4.5\n\nTie bars shall be laid automatically in a fully mechanised construction using slip form paver. For semi mechanised construction tie bars shall be made up into rigid assemblies with adequate supports and fixings to remain firmly in position during the construction of the slab. Alternatively, tie bars at longitudinal joints may be mechanically or manually inserted into the plastic concrete from top by vibration using tie bar inserter.

For all major projects, flexural strength of the mix shall be determined by third point loading of flexural beams (150 mm x 150 mm x 700 mm) as per IS:516. Determination of flexural strength by correlating with cube strength (compressive strength) shall not be allowed for major projects, as the correlation is not well established.\n\n10\n\nIRC:15-2017\n\nWhere it is proposed to estimate the flexural strength by correlating with cube compressive strength, the correlation should first be established with laboratory tests by testing minimum 30 specimens of cubes as well as beams prepared from the same mix which is to be used in the field.\n\n# 4.1.3\n\nWhere facilities for testing beams with three point loading are not available, in such cases, the mix design may be carried out by using compressive strength values and thereafter flexural strength will be determined as per correlation between flexural strength with compressive strength given below.\n\nfcr = 0.7 √(fck) ………………… (1)\n\nWhere fcr is the Flexural strength in MPa or N/mm² and fck is the characteristic compressive strength in MPa or N/mm² as per IS:456. For design of cement concrete mixes, guidance may be taken from IRC:44.\n\n# 4.2 Cement Content\n\nThe minimum cement content for the mix corresponding to achieve flexural strength of 4.5 MPa in the field at 28 days is given in para 4.2.1.\n\n# 4.2.1\n\nMinimum cement content shall be 360 kg/m³ for all type of cements i.e. OPC, PPC, PSC and composite cement. In case fly ash (as per IS:3812- Part 1) is blended at site, the quantity of fly ash shall be restricted to 25 per cent by weight of CM and the quantity of OPC in such a blend shall not be less than 310 kg/m³. In case of GGBFS, minimum cement content shall be 250 kg. If this minimum OPC content is not sufficient to produce concrete of the specified strength, it shall be increased as necessary. The OPC content, however, shall not exceed 450 kg/m³ of concrete.\n\n# 4.3 Approximate Proportions\n\nThe approximate proportions by weight necessary to produce concrete satisfying the above conditions using aggregates from the sources designated may be furnished in the tender documents, for guidance only.

Early-entry saw cutting are dry-cuts so their blades are designed for use without water for cooling. The depth of cut shall be minimum 10 per cent subject to 30 mm minimum.\n\n# 8.2 Types of Joints\n\nThere are four types of joints (IRC:57). These are:\n\n1. Expansion joint: Expansion joint provides the space into which pavement can expand thus relieving compressive stresses due to expansion and inhibiting any tendency towards buckling of concrete slabs.\n2. Contraction joint: Contraction joint relieves tensile stresses in the concrete and prevents formation of irregular cracks due to restraint in free contraction of concrete. Contraction joints also relieve stresses due to warping.\n3. Longitudinal joint: Longitudinal joint relieves stresses due to warping. These are commonly used for dividing the pavement into lanes when width of the slab becomes more than 4.5 m.\n4. Construction Joint: Construction joints are provided whenever day’s construction operations start and stops/ends. These are full depth joints. Construction should be so planned that days construction activity may end at the location of regular contraction joint. It may also be provided where paving stops for more than half an hour due to stoppage of work.\n\nFigs. 2 to 5 show the location of contraction and longitudinal joints. All joints shall be carefully installed in accordance with the location and details given in the plans. The details o",

In any case initial cut of all the transverse and longitudinal joints shall be completed within 24 hours to avoid the random cracking. Subsequent widening of joint groove will be done after 14-16 days of casting concrete pavements. No sealing of joints shall be undertaken before 21 days of construction. All joints shall be sealed using sealants and joints shall be sealed when grooves are dry and clean and free from foreign object or loose material. Alternatively, compression seals or solid seals can also be used to seal the joints after initial cut without widening with the permission of Engineer.\n\nJoint cutting equipment which can be used to cut joint at the early age of concrete is called as early-entry saw. This is light weight equipment and has a plate on both sides of saw to keep concrete pressed at the location of saw cutting to basically control raveling. With use of early-entry joint cutting equipment, joints can be cut even earlier than that mentioned above using early-entry saw with the permission of the Engineer.

Contraction, construction and expansion joints shall be continuous from edge to edge of the pavement through all lanes constructed at the same or different times. These shall extend over the entire width of the pavement. The maximum transverse joint spacing shall be 4.5 m.\n\nTransverse joints shall be straight within the following tolerances along the intended line of joints which is the straight-line transverse to the longitudinal axis of the carriageway at the position proposed by the Engineer, except at road junctions or roundabouts where the position shall be as described in the drawings:\n\n- (i) Deviations of the filler board in the case of expansion joints from the intended line of the joint shall not be greater than ± 10 mm.\n- (ii) The best fit straight line through the joint grooves as constructed shall not be more than 25 mm from the intended line of the joint.\n- (iii) Deviations of the joint groove from the best fit straight line of the joint shall not be greater than 10 mm.\n- (iv) Transverse joints on each side of the longitudinal joint shall be in line with each other and of the same type and width. Transverse joints shall have a sealing groove which shall be sealed as per Clause 8.6 and 8.7.\n- (v) The transverse joints at curves shall be radial in the direction of the radius.\n\n# 8.3.2 Transverse Expansion Joints\n\nThey shall be of the dimensions and spacing as shown on the drawing. These shall be provided only where PQC abuts a bridge, under passes and culvert.\n\n| SEALANT                   | SEALANT                       | SEALANT                         |\n| ------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------- |\n| STRESS FREE CONDITION     | TENSILE STRESS AT SEALANT     | BOND STRESS AT INTERFACE        |\n| PEELING STRESS AT EDGE    | COMPRESSION STRESS IN SEALANT | TENSILE STRESS IN FACE MATERIAL |\n| INITIAL CONDITION OF SLAB | WHEN SLAB CONTRACTS           | WHEN SLAB EXPANDS               |\n\nFig. 6: Shape of Joint Sealing Groove\n\n(Shape Factor = Depth of sealant/Width of sealant = 1.0-1.25 for Hot Poured",

It may sometimes be necessary to provide more number of expansion joints in succession in such locations to release the pressure. Expansion joints against culverts, underpasses etc. having RCC box structure should normally be avoided by taking the PQC over the deck of such structures. To deal with the lack of compaction in the vicinity of structures and subsequent settlement, RCC approach slabs must be provided on both sides abutting with DLC layer. Wherever, PQC is taken over the deck of structures, underpasses etc., saw cut transverse construction joints must be provided just above the deck and approach slabs on both sides to avoid full depth transverse cracks in PQC.\n\n8.3.2.2 Dowel bars as per dimensions, location and spacing shown on the drawing are required at expansion joints to transfer wheel loads to the adjacent slab.

It may sometimes be necessary to provide more number of expansion joints in succession in such locations to release the pressure. Expansion joints against culverts, underpasses etc. having RCC box structure should normally be avoided by taking the PQC over the deck of such structures. To deal with the lack of compaction in the vicinity of structures and subsequent settlement, RCC approach slabs must be provided on both sides abutting with DLC layer. Wherever, PQC is taken over the deck of structures, underpasses etc., saw cut transverse construction joints must be provided just above the deck and approach slabs on both sides to avoid full depth transverse cracks in PQC.\n\n8.3.2.2 Dowel bars as per dimensions, location and spacing shown on the drawing are required at expansion joints to transfer wheel loads to the adjacent slab. For slabs of thickness less than 200 mm dowel bars may not be provided (IS:6509). The pre-moulded synthetic expansion joint filler board, a compressible material shall be used to fill the gap between adjacent slabs at expansion joint. The height of the filler board shall be such that its top is 25 mm below the surface of the pavement. The accurate placing of dowels at the end of the day may be achieved by means of sufficiently strong bulkheads made of steel sections with holes drilled along the centre line to accommodate the dowel bars in a mild steel section and clamping arrangement not allowing displacement of bars while placing and compacting concrete. The bulkhead shall be oiled or greased before placing in position to avoid bonding with concrete. The top and bottom edges of the bulkheads and mild steel section shall be shaped to correspond to camber of the pavements at the joint. If considered convenient, two-piece split bulkheads may also be used. When dowel bars are provided, bulkheads shall be designed such that they can hold the projecting ends of the dowel bars to maintain their alignment and keep all bars parallel to each other. A box section normally is adopted for such designs.\n\n8.3.2.3 The bulkheads shall be securely fixed in place at right angles to the centre line and surface of the pavement with sufficient stakes to hold them in the specified position.

Additionally, one of the wires shall be kept at a constant horizontal distance from the required edge of the pavement as indicated in the contract/drawing within a lateral tolerance of ± 10 mm.\n\n47\n\nIRC:15-2017\n\n10.1.12.3 The guidewires shall be supported on stakes not more than 6 m apart by connectors capable of fine horizontal and vertical adjustment. The stake to stake distance in case of paving at curve shall suitably be decreased. The guidewires shall be tensioned on the stakes so that a 500 gm weight shall produce a deflection of not more than 20 mm when suspended at the midpoint between any pair of stakes. The ends of the guidewires shall be anchored to fixing point or winch and not on the stakes.\n\n10.1.12.4 The stakes shall be positioned and the connectors maintained at their correct height and alignment 12 hours before concreting takes place and until 12 hours after finishing of the concrete. The guidewires shall be checked and tensioned on the connectors at any section at least 2 hours before concreting that section.\n\n10.1.12.5 The Engineer shall inspect and approve the line and level, the stakes and connectors which are ready for use in the length of road to be constructed at least 12 hours before the day of construction of slab. Any deficiencies noted by the Engineer shall be rectified. Engineer shall also check the level before the commencement of work. Work shall not proceed until the Engineer has given his approval. It shall be ensured that the stakes and guidewires are not affected by the construction equipment when concreting is in progress. Arrangements should be readily available to correct it in case the string line is inadvertently disturbed.\n\n10.1.12.6 Use of 3D Pave System (String less Paving) Instead of using guidewires, the concrete should preferably be paved with slip form pavers fitted with latest 3D Pave system based on Total Station. This system ensures very high level of accuracy in elevation, slope, automatic steering of the paver, and better riding quality.\n\n# 10.1.13 Construction by Slip Form Pa",

Where the general unevenness/rutting of the surface varies within 25 mm, it can be provided with an overlay of Dense Bituminous Macadam (DBM) with the help of a paver operating with electronic sensor to achieve the desired level, grade and alignment. The details are given in IRC:SP:16/IRC:SP:76. The thickness of DBM shall be decided on basis of undulations present on the existing road. Alternatively, the existing bituminous pavement can be milled to recycle the existing asphalt mix and paved as a sub-base after treating the material with fresh bitumen and aggregates as per standard practice.\n\n# 10.6 Widening of Existing PQC\n\nWhenever the widening of existing PQC is undertaken by the addition of lanes, the thickness of PQC, DLC, and GSB layers should be kept same as that of existing layers in order to drain off the water across the pavement surface as well as through GSB drainage layer.

The depth of the hole shall be half the length of the tie bar. The holes shall be cleaned properly with compressed air to remove all dust or dirt from inside the hole. Resin based epoxy shall be injected into the full depth of the hole. Afterwards, the tie bar is inserted into the hole till end with a revolving motion and held for some time to develop a grip on setting of the epoxy. The extra oozed out epoxy from the hole shall be wiped off the surface.\n\nWhile laying PQC, the levels of the edge of existing PQC shall be followed for matching the longitudinal joint between the existing and freshly laid PQC.

They are used mainly for (i) concreting in hot weather, where the setting time may get reduced (due to high temperature) to the extent that it may not be possible to complete compaction and finishing operations before the concrete begins to set, (ii) ready mixed concrete which is to be transported, where the time for transportation to the site, laying, compaction and finishing has to be extended, before the concrete begins to set. Some retarders tend to reduce the rate of development of strength and also reduce the ultimate strength. Experiments have shown that sugar, when used up to a maximum of 0.05 per cent by weight of cement, can be very effective in retarding the setting time of concrete. It may, however, be noted that quantities of sugar in excess of 0.05 per cent by weight of cement may prove to be harmful.\n\n# 12.19.5 Superlasticizers/Poly Carboxylate Ether (PCE) High Range Water Reducing Admixture (HRWRA)\n\nThese are used as water-reducing agents, so that for a given workability, the water-cement ratio can be reduced to achieve a higher strength as compared to mix without the additive.

It may have advantages, by virtue of the greater cohesion and workability it develops, in facilitating the production of a good riding surface and in reducing flow on gradients and cross-falls.\n\n\n\nIRC:15-2017\n\n# 12.19.3 Accelerators\n\nThese are used to accelerate the setting and hardening of cement concrete for (i) effecting economy in curing and formwork by speeding up the progress of the concrete works, (ii) concreting in cold weather, the rate of hardening being slow at very low temperatures and (iii) emergency repairs by producing a flash set, sometimes even in minutes. The most common accelerator that has been successfully used is calcium chloride, which increases the rate of heat evolution; this is very beneficial in cold weather (sub-zero temperatures). However, when used in hot weather, the initial stiffening can be too rapid. The quantity of calcium chloride to be used should ordinarily not exceed 2 per cent by weight of cement used. It is important to see that calcium chloride should be thoroughly dissolved in the mixing water, and that the solution is evenly distributed throughout the batch. The use of calcium chloride is not permitted when reinforcement is provided, due to the possibility of corrosion.

Under the conditions of corners warping upward so that they are completely unsupported, the stresses at the corners of various angles calculated theoretically and expressed in terms of stress at a right-angled corner, are approximately be 100 per cent, 145 per cent and 210 per cent for 90o, 70o and 50o respectively.\n\n# 12.20.2\n\nIf acute angled corners are unavoidable, as sometimes is the case at intersections, the corners should be strengthened either by increasing the slab thickness at this point, or by heavy reinforcement or by both.\n\n# 12.20.3\n\nThe shape and dimensions of the slabs, in transitioning from one width to another or where changes in direction are necessary, should be such as easily negotiated by traffic, pleasing to the eyes and also permit the satisfactory compaction and finishing of the top surface.\n\n\n\nIRC:15-2017\n\n# 12.20.4 Spacing of Joints\n\nThe spacing of transverse joints depends on several factors, the more important of which are the coefficient of thermal expansion of the concrete, the temperature during placing, the frictional restraint of the DLC sub-base to the movement of the slab, the thickness of the slab and the amount of reinforcement. For unreinforced concrete pavement, the spacing of joints shall be such as to obviate the formation of uncontrolled cracks which would open and give rise to spalling. For reinforced concrete slab, the spacing of joints should be related to the weight of reinforcement so that opening of hair cracks is effectively controlled.\n\n# 12.20.5 Sealant\n\nThe sealant should not be more than six mo",
