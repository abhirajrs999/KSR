In the last decade and a half, significant developments have taken place in the highways sector. The massive National Highways Development Projects (NHDP) undertaken by the Government of India is in progress involving execution of a large number of high value road projects. These require adoption of latest international practices so as to achieve technical excellence and the best quality. Concrete bridges have also undergone major changes with development of new structural forms, new methods of computer based analysis and design and development of high strength materials, IRC:112 for concrete bridges based on the limit state method has come into force. Over the past few years, many IRC codes have also been completely revised necessitating extensive changes in the Ministry\u2019s specifications for road and bridge works.\n\nSome of the important additions in this revision of Specifications for Road and Bridge Works cover stone mastic asphalt, microsurfacing, sand asphalt base course, prefabricated vertical drains (PVD), natural geo textiles, geo cells for use in base and sub base in pavement and slope protection, variable message sign boards, soil nailing, cold applied retro-reflective paints, audible and vibratory pavement markings, solar powered road markers, traffic control &#x26; safety devices in construction zone, traffic impact attenuators and advance traffic management system. Some of the new areas covered in bridges include high performance concrete, HDPE sheathings, Pot-PTFE bearings, jack down method of well sinking, dynamic testing of piles and mechanically woven wire crates for gabions.\n\nThe Fifth Revision of the Specifications for Road and Bridge Works is the result of the concerted efforts of the officers of the Roads Wing and other professionals who contributed to the drafting of this document. I wish to express my gratitude to all of them and the Indian Roads Congress for undertaking the assignment of bringing out this publication. Feedback and suggestion for further improvement would be welcome from users of this edition.\n\n(C.

The same shall not, however, apply in the case of lumpsum contracts.\n\nAll measurements and computations, unless otherwise indicated, shall be carried nearest to the following limits:\n\n- i) length and width 10 mm\n- ii) height, depth or thickness of\n- - a) earthwork, subgrade, 5 mm\n- b) sub-bases, bases, surfacing 5 mm\n\niii) structural members 2.5 mm\n- iv) areas 0.01 sq.m\n- v) volume 0.01 cu.m\n\nIn recording dimensions of work, the sequence of length, width and height or depth or thickness shall be followed.\n\n# 113.2 Measurement of lead for Materials\n\nWhere lead is specified in the Contract for construction materials, the same shall be measured as described hereunder:\n\nLead shall be measured over the shortest practicable route and not the one actually taken and the decision of the Engineer in this regard shall be taken as final. Distances up to and including 100 m shall be measured in units of 50 m, exceeding 100 m but not exceeding 1 km in units of 100 m and exceeding 1 km in units of 500 m, the half and greater than half of the unit shall be reckoned as one and less than half of the unit ignored. In this regard, the source of the material shall be divided into suitable blocks and for each block, the distance from the centre of placing pertaining to that block shall be taken as the lead distance.\n\n# 113.3 Measurement of pavement thickness for payment on Volume Basis\n\nThe finished thickness of sub-bases, base and bituminous layers and concrete courses to be\n\n\n\nGeneral Section 100\n\nPaid on volume basis shall be computed in the following manner:\n\nLevels shall be taken before and after construction, at the grid of points 10 m centre-to-centre longitudinally in straight reaches and 5 m centre-to-centre at curves. Normally, on two-lane roads, the levels shall be taken at four positions transversely, at 0.75 m and 2.75 m from either edge of the carriageway and on single-lane roads, these shall be taken at two positions transversely, being at 1.25 m from either edge of the carriageway. For multi-lane roads, levels shall be taken at two positions transversely for each lane. The transverse position for levels shall be 0.75 m from either edge of the carriageway and the remaining locations shall be at equi-distance in the balance portion of carriageway. For paved shoulder an additional level shall be taken at the centre of the shoulder.\n\nSuitable references for the transverse grid lines should be left in the form of embedded bricks on both ends or by other means so that it is possible to locate the grid points for level measurements after each successive course is laid.\n\nFor pavement courses laid only over widening portions, at least one line of levels shall be taken on each strip of widening, or more depending on the width of widening as decided by the Engineer.\n\nNotwithstanding the above, the measurements may be taken at closer intervals also, if so desired by the Engineer, the need for which may arise particularly in the case of estimation of the volume of the material for profile corrective course (levelling course). The average thickness of the pavement course in any area shall be the arithmetic mean of the difference of levels before and after construction at all the grid points falling in that area, provided that the thickness of finished work shall be limited to those shown on the drawings or approved by the engineer in writing.\n\nAs supplement to level measurements, the Engineer shall have the option to take cores/make holes to check the depth of construction. The holes made and the portions cut for taking cores shall be made good by the Contractor by laying fresh mix/material including compacting as required at his own cost immediately after the measurements are recorded.\n\n# 113.4 Checking of pavement thickness for payment on area Basis\n\nWhere payment for any bituminous course in Section 500 is allowed to be made on the area basis, the Engineer may have its thickness checked with the help of a suitable penetration gauge at regular intervals or other means as he may decide.\n\n# 113.5 Measurement of Bituminous courses for payment on weight Basis\n\nPlant-mixed bituminous materials for pavement courses, where specifically designated in the contract to be paid on weight basis, shall be weighed on accurate scales approved by the Engineer.

Merely the use of explosives in excavation will not be considered as a reason for higher classification unless blasting is clearly necessary in the opinion of the Engineer.\n\n# 301.3 Construction Operations\n\n# 301.3.1 Setting Out\n\nAfter the site has been cleared as per Clause 201, the limits of excavation shall be set out true to lines, curves, slopes, grades and sections as shown on the drawings or as directed by the Engineer. Clause 109 shall be applicable for the setting out operations.\n\n# 301.3.2 Stripping and Storing Topsoil\n\nWhen so directed by the Engineer, the topsoil existing over the sites of excavation shall be\n\nEarthwork, Erosion Control and Drainage\n# Section 300\n\nstripped to specified depths and stockpiled at designated locations for re-use in covering embankment slopes, cut slopes, berms and other disturbed areas where re-vegetation is desired in accordance with Clause 305.3.3. Prior to stripping the topsoil, all trees, shrubs etc. shall be removed along with their roots, with approval of the Engineer.\n\n# 301.3.3 excavation\u2013general\n\nAll excavations shall be carried out in conformity with the directions laid here-in-under and in a manner approved by the Engineer. The work shall be so done that the suitable materials available from excavation are satisfactorily utilized as deemed fit or as approved by the Engineer.\n\nWhile planning or executing excavations, the Contractor shall take all adequate precautions against soil erosion, water pollution etc. as per Clause 306, and take appropriate drainage measures to keep the site free of water in accordance with Clause 311.\n\nThe excavations shall conform to the lines, grades, side slopes and levels shown on the drawings or as directed by the Engineer. The Contractor shall not excavate outside the limits of excavation. Subject to the permitted tolerances, any excess depth/width excavated beyond the specified levels/dimensions on the drawings shall be made good at the cost of the Contractor with suitable material of characteristics similar to that removed and compacted to the requirements of Clause 305.\n\nAll debris and loose material on the slopes of cuttings shall be removed. No backfilling shall be allowed to obtain required slopes excepting that when boulders or soft materials are encountered in cut slopes, these shall be excavated to approved depth on instructions of the Engineer and the resulting cavities filled with suitable material and thoroughly compacted in an appropriate manner.\n\nAfter excavation, the sides of excavated area shall be trimmed and the area contoured to minimize erosion and ponding, allowing for natural drainage to take place.\n\n# 301.3.4 Methods, tools and equipment\n\nOnly such methods, tools and equipment as approved by the Engineer shall be adopted/used in the work. If so desired by the Engineer, the Contractor shall demonstrate the efficacy of the type of equipment to be used before the commencement of work.\n\n# 301.3.5 rock excavation\n\nRock, when encountered in road excavation, shall be removed upto the formation level or as otherwise indicated in the drawings. Where, however, unstable shales or other unsuitable materials are encountered at the formation level, these shall be excavated to the extent of\n\nSection 300\n# Earthwork, Erosion Control and Drainage\n\n500 mm below the formation level or as otherwise specified. In all cases, the excavation operations shall be so carried out that at no point on cut formations the rock protrudes above the specified levels. Rocks and boulders which are likely to cause differential settlement and also local drainage problems shall be removed to the extent of 500 mm below the formation level in the formation width including side drains.\n\nWhere excavation is done to levels lower than those specified, the excess excavation shall be made good as per Clauses 301.3.3 and 301.6 to the satisfaction of the Engineer. Slopes in rock cutting shall be finished to uniform lines corresponding to slope lines shown on the drawings or as directed by the Engineer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all loose pieces of rock on excavated slope surface which move when pierced by a crowbar shall be removed.\n\nWhere blasting is to be resorted to, the same shall be carried out as per Clause 302 and all precautions indicated therein observed. Where presplitting is prescribed to be done for the establishment of a specified slope in rock excavation, the same shall be carried out as per Clause 303.\n\n# 301.3.6 Marsh excavation\n\nThe excavation of soil from marshes/swamps shall be carried out as per the programme approved by the Engineer. Excavation of marshes shall begin at one end and proceed in one direction across the entire marsh immediately ahead of backfilling with materials like boulders, sand moorum, bricks bats, dismantled concrete as approved by the Engineer. The method and sequence of excavating and backfilling shall be such as to ensure, to the extent practicable, the complete removal or displacement of all muck from within the lateral limits indicated on the drawings or as staked by the Engineer.\n\n# 301.3.7 Excavation of road shoulders/Verge/Median for widening of pavement or providing treated shoulders\n\nIn the works involving widening of existing pavements or providing paved shoulders, the existing shoulders/verge/median shall be removed to its full width and up to top of the subgrade. The subgrade material within 500 mm from the bottom of the pavement for the widened portion or paved shoulders shall be loosened and recompacted as per Clause 305. Any unsuitable material found in this portion shall be removed and replaced with the suitable material. While doing so, care shall be taken to see that no portion of the existing pavement designated for retention is loosened or disturbed. If the existing pavement gets disturbed or loosened, it shall be dismantled and cut to a regular shape with sides vertical and the\n\n48\n\nEarthwork, Erosion Control and Drainage\n# Section 300\n\ndisturbed/loosened portion removed completely and relaid as directed by the Engineer, at the cost of the Contractor.\n\n# 301.3.8 excavation for surface/sub-surface drains\n\nWhere the Contract provides for construction of surface/sub-surface drains, the same shall be done as per Clause 309. Excavation for these drains shall be carried out in proper sequence with other works as approved by the Engineer.\n\n# 301.3.9 slides\n\nIf slips, slides, over-breaks or subsidence occur in cuttings during the process of construction, they shall be removed at the cost of the Contractor as ordered by the Engineer. Adequate precautions shall be taken to ensure that during construction, the slopes are not rendered unstable or give rise to recurrent slides after construction. If finished slopes slide into the roadway subsequently, such slides shall be removed and paid for at the Contract rate for the class of excavation involved, provided the slides are not due to any negligence on the part of the Contractor. The classification of the debris material from the slips, slides etc. shall conform to its condition at the time of removal and payment made accordingly regardless of its condition earlier.\n\n# 301.3.10 dewatering\n\nIf water is met with in the excavations due to springs, seepage, rain or other causes, it shall be removed by suitable diversions, pumping or bailing out and the excavation kept dry whenever so required or directed by the Engineer. Care shall be taken to discharge the drained water into suitable outlets as not to cause damage to the works, crops or any other property. Due to any negligence on the part of the Contractor, if any such damage is caused, it shall be the sole responsibility of the Contractor to repair/restore to the original condition at his own cost or compensate for the damage.\n\n# 301.3.11 use and disposal of excavated Materials\n\nAll the excavated materials shall either be reused with the approval of the Engineer or disposed off with all leads and lifts as directed by the Engineer.\n\n# 301.3.12 Backfilling\n\nBackfilling of masonry/concrete hume pipe or drain excavation shall be done with approved material with all leads and lifts after concrete/masonry/hume pipe is fully set and carried out in such a way as not to cause undue thrust on any part of the structure and/or not to cause differential settlement. All space between the drain walls and the side of the excavation\n\n\n\nSection 300\n# Earthwork, Erosion Control and Drainage\n\nshall be backfilled to the original surface making due allowance for settlement, in layers not exceeding 150 mm compacted thickness to the required density, using suitable compaction equipment such as trench compactor, mechanical tamper, rammer or plate compactor as directed by the Engineer.\n\n# 301.4 Plying of Construction Traffic\n\nConstruction traffic shall not use the cut formation and finished subgrade without the prior permission of the Engineer. Any damage arising out of such use shall be made good by the Contractor at his own cost.\n\n# 301.5 Preservation of Property\n\nThe Contractor shall undertake all reasonable precautions for the protection and preservation of any or all existing roadside trees, drains, sewers, sub-surface drains, pipes, conduits and any other structures under or above ground, which may be affected by construction operations and which, in the opinion of the Engineer, shall be continued in use without any change. Safety measures taken by the Contractor in this respect, shall be got approved from the Engineer. However, if any of these objects is damaged by reason of the Contractor\u2019s negligence, it shall be replaced or restored to the original condition at his cost. If the Contractor fails to do so, within the required time as directed by the Engineer or if, in the opinion of the Engineer, the actions initiated by the Contractor to replace/restore the damaged objects are not satisfactory, the Engineer shall arrange the replacement/restoration directly through any other agency at the risk and cost of the Contractor after issuing prior notice to the effect.\n\n# 301.6 Preparation of Cut Formation\n\nThe cut formation, which serves as a sub-grade, shall be prepared to receive the sub-base/base course as directed by the Engineer.\n\nWhere the material in the subgrade has a density less than specified in Table 300-1, the same shall be loosened to a depth of 500 mm and compacted in layers in accordance with the requirements of Clause 305 adding fresh material, if any required, to maintain the formation level as shown on the drawings. Any unsuitable material encountered in the subgrade level shall be removed as directed by the Engineer, replaced with suitable material and compacted in accordance with Clause 305.\n\nIn rocky formations, the surface irregularities shall be corrected and the levels brought up to the specified elevation with granular base material as directed by the Engineer, laid and compacted in accordance with the respective Specifications for these materials. The unsuitable material shall be disposed of in accordance with Clause 301.3.11.\n\n50\n\nEarthwork, Erosion Control and Drainage\n# Section 300\n\nThe density requirements, the cut formation shall be prepared to receive the sub-base/base course in accordance with Clauses 310 and 311.\n\n# 301.7 Finishing Operations\n\nFinishing operations shall include the work of properly shaping and dressing all excavated surfaces.\n\nWhen completed, no point on the slopes shall vary from the designated slopes by more than 150 mm measured at right angles to the slope, except where excavation is in rock (ordinary or hard) where no point shall vary more than 300 mm from the designated slope. In no case shall any portion of the slope encroach on the roadway.\n\nThe finished cut formation shall satisfy the surface tolerances described in Clause 902.\n\nWhere directed, the topsoil removed and conserved (Clauses 301.3.2 and 305.3.3) shall be spread over cut slopes, shoulders and other disturbed areas. Slopes may be roughened and moistened slightly, prior to the application of topsoil, in order to provide satisfactory bond.\n\nThe depth of topsoil shall be sufficient to sustain plant growth, the usual thickness being from 75 mm to 100 mm.\n\n# 301.8 Measurements for Payment\n\nExcavation for roadway shall be measured by taking cross-sections at suitable intervals before the excavation starts (after clearing and grubbing/stripping etc. as the case may be) and after its completion and computing the volumes in cu.m by the method of average end areas for each class of material encountered. Where it is not feasible to compute volumes by this method because of erratic location of isolated deposits, the volumes shall be computed by other accepted methods.\n\nAt the option of the Engineer, the Contractor shall leave depth indicators during excavations of such shape and size and in such positions as directed so as to indicate the original ground level as accurately as possible. The Contractor shall see that these remain intact till the final measurements are taken.\n\nFor rock excavation, the overburden shall be removed first so that necessary cross-sections could be taken for measurement. Where cross-sectional measurements could not be taken due to irregular configuration or where the rock is admixed with other classes of materials, the volumes shall be computed on the basis of measurement of stacks of excavated rubble allowing a deduction of 35% therefrom. When volume is calculated on the basis of measurement of stacks of the excavated material other than rock, a deduction of 16% of stacked volume shall be allowed.\n\n51\n\nSection 300                                           Earthwork, Erosion Control and Drainage\n\nWorks involved in the preparation of cut formation shall be measured in units indicated below:\n\n- i) Loosening and recompacting the loosened material at subgrade \u2026.cu.m\n- ii) Loosening and removal of unsuitable material and replacing with suitable material and compacting to required density \u2026cu.m\n- iii) Preparing rocky subgrade \u2026sq.m\n- iv) Stripping including storing and reapplication of topsoil \u2026cu.m\n\n# 301.9 rates\n\n# 301.9.1\n\nThe Contract unit rates for the items of roadway and drain excavation shall be payment in full for carrying out the operations required for the individual items including full compensation for:\n\n- i) setting out;\n- ii) transporting the excavated materials for use or disposal with all leads and lifts by giving suitable credit towards the cost of re-usable material and salvage value of unusable material;\n- iii) trimming bottoms and slopes of excavation;\n- iv) dewatering;\n- v) keeping the work free of water as per Clause 311;\n- vi) arranging disposal sites; and\n- vii) all labour, materials, tools, equipment, safety measures, testing and incidentals necessary to complete the work to Specifications.\n\nWhere presplitting of rock is prescribed it shall be governed by Clause 303.5.\n\n# 301.9.2\n\nThe Contract unit rate for loosening and recompacting the loosened materials at subgrade shall include full compensation for loosening to the specified depth, including breaking clods, spreading in layers, watering where necessary and compacting to the requirements.\n\n# 301.9.3\n\nClauses 301.9.1 and 305.8 shall apply as regards Contract unit rate for item of removal of unsuitable material and replacement with suitable material respectively.\n\n# 301.9.4\n\nThe Contract unit rate for item of preparing rocky sub-grade as per Clause 301.6 shall be full compensation for providing, laying and compacting granular base material for correcting surface irregularities including all materials, labour and incidentals necessary to complete the work and all leads and lifts.\n\n52\n\nEarthwork, Erosion Control and Drainage\n# Section 300\n\n301.9.5 The Contract unit rate for the items of stripping and storing topsoil and of reapplication of topsoil shall include full compensation for all the necessary operations including all lifts and leads.\n\n# 302 Blasting operations\n\n# 302.1 general\n\nBlasting shall be carried out in a manner that completes the excavation to the lines indicated in drawings, with the least disturbance to adjacent material. It shall be done only with the written permission of the Engineer. All the statutory laws, regulations, rules, etc., pertaining to the acquisition, transportation, storage, handling and use of explosives shall be strictly followed by the contractor.\n\nThe Contractor may adopt any method or methods of blasting consistent with the safety and job requirements. Prior to starting any phase of the operation, the Contractor shall provide information describing pertinent blasting procedures, dimensions and notes.\n\nThe magazine for the storage of explosives shall be built to the designs and specifications of the Explosives Department concerned and located at the approved site. The storage places shall be clearly marked \u201cDANGER-EXPLOSIVES\u201d. The Contractor shall be liable for property damage, injury or death resulting from the use of explosives. All permits shall be obtained by the Contractor. No unauthorized person shall be admitted into the magazine which, when not in use, shall be kept securely locked. No matches or inflammable material shall be allowed in the magazine. The magazine shall have an effective lightning conductor. The following shall be hung in the lobby of the magazine:\n\n- a) A copy of the relevant rules regarding safe storage both in English and in the language with which the workers concerned are familiar,\n- b) A statement of up-to-date stock in the magazine,\n- c) A certificate showing the last date of testing of the lightning conductor, and\n- d) A notice that smoking is strictly prohibited.\n\nAll explosives shall be stored in a secure manner in compliance with all laws and ordinances, and all such storage places shall be marked. Where no local laws or ordinances apply, storage shall be provided to the satisfaction of the Engineer and in general not closer than 300 m from the road or from any building or camping area or place of human occupancy. In addition to these, the Contractor shall also observe the following instructions and any further additional instructions which may be given by the Engineer and shall be responsible for damage to property and any accident which may occur to workmen or public on account of any operations connected with the storage, handling or use of explosives and blasting. The Engineer shall frequently check the Contractor\u2019s compliance with these precautions.\n\n53\n\nSection 300                                       Earthwork, Erosion Control and Drainage\n\n# 302.2 Materials, tools and equipment\n\nAll the materials, tools and equipment used for blasting operations shall be of approved type. The Engineer may specify the type of explosives to be allowed in special cases. The fuse to be used in wet locations shall be sufficiently water-resistant as to be unaffected when immersed in water for 30 minutes. The rate of burning of the fuse shall be uniform and definitely known to permit such a length being cut as will permit sufficient time to the firer to reach safely before explosion takes place. Detonators shall be capable of giving effective blasting of the explosives. The blasting powder, explosives, detonators, fuses, etc., shall be fresh and not damaged due to dampness, moisture or any other cause. They shall be inspected before use and damaged articles shall be discarded totally and removed from the site immediately.\n\n# 302.3 personnel\n\nThe blasting operation shall remain in the charge of competent and experienced supervisor and workmen who are thoroughly acquainted with the details of handling explosives and blasting operations.\n\n# 302.4 Blasting operations\n\nThe blasting shall be carried out during the pre-determined hours of the day preferably during the mid-day luncheon hour or at the close of the work as ordered in writing by the Engineer. The hours shall be made known to the people in the vicinity.\n\nThe Contractor shall notify each public utility company having structures in proximity to the site of the work of his intention to use explosives. Such notice shall be given sufficiently in advance to enable the companies to take such steps as they may deem necessary to protect their property from injury. In advance of any blasting work within 50 m of any railway track or structures, the Contractor shall notify the concerned Railway Authority of the location, date, time and approximate duration of such blasting operation.\n\nRed danger flags shall be displayed prominently in all directions during the blasting operations. The flags shall be planted 200 m from the blasting site in all directions. People, except those who actually light the fuse, shall be prohibited from entering this area and all persons including workmen shall be kept away from the flagged area, and all persons including workmen shall be removed from the flagged area at least 10 minutes before the firing. A warning siren shall be sounded for the above purpose.\n\nOnly controlled blasting shall be resorted to along with the safeguard above at locations where built-up area, huts and structures in use lie within 200 m. Similarly excavation of hard rock without blasting is mandatory where people live within 20 m of blast site.\n\n54\n\nEarthwork, Erosion Control and Drainage\n# Section 300\n\nThe charge holes shall be drilled to required depths and at suitable places. Blasting should be as light as possible consistent with thorough breakage of the material necessary for economic loading and hauling. Any method of blasting which leads to overshooting shall be discontinued.\n\nWhen blasting is done with powder, the fuse cut to the required length shall be inserted into the hole and the powder dropped shall be gently tamped with copper roads with rounded ends. The explosive powder shall then be covered with tamping material which shall be tamped lightly but firmly.\n\nWhen blasting is done with dynamite and other high explosives, dynamite cartridges shall be prepared by inserting the square cut end of a fuse into the detonator and finishing it with nippers at the open end, the detonator gently pushed into the primer leaving 1/3\u02b3\u1d48 of the copper tube exposed outside. The paper of the cartridge shall then be closed up and securely bound with wire or twine. The primer shall be housed into the explosive. Boreholes shall be cleared of all debris and explosives inserted. The space of about 200 mm above the charge shall then be gently filled with dry clay, pressed home and the rest of the tamping formed of any convenient material gently packed with a wooden rammer.\n\nAt a time not more than 10 such charges will be prepared and fired. The man in charge shall blow a siren in a recognized manner for cautioning the people. All the people shall then be required to move to safe distances. The charges shall be lighted by the man-in-charge only. The man-in-charge shall count the number of explosions. He shall satisfy himself that all the charges have been exploded before allowing the workmen to go back to the work site.\n\nAfter blasting operation, the Contractor shall compact the loose residual material below subgrade and replace the material removed below subgrade with suitable material.\n\n# 302.5 Misfire\n\nIn case of misfire, the following procedure shall be observed:\n\n1. Sufficient time shall be allowed to account for the delayed blast. The man-in-charge shall inspect all the charges and determine the missed charge.\n2. If it is the blasting powder charge, it shall be completely flooded with water. A new hole shall be drilled at about 450 mm from the old hole and fired. This should blast the old charge. In case, it does not blast the old charge, the procedure shall be repeated till the old charge is blasted.\n3. In case of charges of gelignite, dynamite, etc., the man-in-charge shall gently remove the tamping and the primer with the detonator. A fresh detonator and primer shall then be used to blast the charge. Alternatively,\n\n\n\nSection 300                                      Earthwork, Erosion Control and Drainage\n\nThe hole may be cleared of 300 mm of tamping and the direction then ascertained by placing a stick in the hole. Another hole may then be drilled 150 mm away and parallel to it. This hole shall then be charged and fired when the misfired hole should explode at the same time. The man-in-charge shall at once report to the Contractor\u2019s office and the Engineer all cases of misfire, the cause of the same and what steps were taken in connection therewith.\n\nIf a misfire has been found to be due to defective detonator or dynamite, the whole quantity in the box from which defective article was taken must be sent to the authority directed by the Engineer for inspection to ascertain whether all the remaining materials in the box are also defective.\n\n# 302.6           account\n\nA careful and day to day account of the explosive shall be maintained by the Contractor in an approved register and manner which shall be open to inspection by the Engineer at all times.\n\n# 303             presplitting rock excavation slopes\n\n# 303.1           general\n\nPresplitting is defined as the establishment of a specified excavation slope in rock by the controlled use of explosives and blasting accessories in properly aligned and spaced drill holes.\n\nThe presplitting technique shall be used for forming rock excavation slopes at locations shown on the drawings or as otherwise decided by the Engineer.\n\n# 303.2           construction operations\n\nPrior to starting drilling operations for presplitting, the Contractor shall furnish the Engineer a plan outlining the position of all drill holes, depth of drilling, type of explosives to be used, loading pattern and sequence of firing. The drilling and blasting plan is for record purposes only and will not absolve the Contractor of his responsibility for using proper drilling and blasting procedures. Controlled blasting shall begin with a short test section of a length approved by the Engineer. The test section shall be presplit, production drilled and blasted and sufficient material excavated whereby the Engineer can determine if the Contractor\u2019s method have produced an acceptable slope.\n\nAll overburden soil and weathered rock along the top of the excavation for a distance of about 5 to 15 m beyond the drilling limits, or to the end of the excavation, as decided by the Engineer.\n\n\n\nEarthwork, Erosion Control and Drainage\n# Section 300\n\nEngineer shall be removed before drilling the presplitting holes. Particular care and attention shall be directed to the beginning and end of excavations to ensure complete removal of all overburden soil and weathered rock and to expose fresh rock to an elevation equal to the bottom of the adjacent lift of the presplitting holes being drilled.\n\nSlope holes for presplitting shall be drilled along the line of the planned slope within the specified tolerances. The drill holes shall not be less than 60 mm nor more than 75 mm in diameter. Drilling operations shall be controlled by the use of proper equipment and technique to ensure that no hole shall deviate from the plane of the planned slope by more than 300 mm nor shall any hole deviate from being parallel to an adjacent hole by more than two-third of the planned horizontal spacing between holes.\n\nThe length of presplit holes for any individual lift shall not exceed 9 m. The spacing of presplit holes shall not exceed 900 mm on centres and shall be adjusted to result in a uniform shear face between holes.\n\nAuxiliary drill holes along the presplit line, not loaded or stemmed, may be ordered by the Engineer. Except for spacing, auxiliary drill holes shall conform to the provisions for presplit holes.\n\nThe line of production holes shall be placed inside the presplit lines in such a manner as to avoid damage to the presplit face.\n\nIf necessary, to reduce shatter and overbreak of the presplit surface, the first line of the production holes shall be drilled parallel to the slope line at the top of the cut and at each bench level thereafter.\n\nAny blasting technique, which results in damage to the presplit surface, shall be immediately discontinued.\n\nNo portion of any production holes shall be drilled within 2.5 m of a presplit plane except as approved by the Engineer. The bottom of the production holes shall not be lower than the bottom of the presplit holes.\n\nA maximum offset of 600 mm will be permitted for a construction working bench at the bottom of each lift for use in drilling the next lower presplitting pattern. The drilling operations shall be adjusted to compensate for drift of previous levels and for the offset at the start of new levels to maintain the specified slope plane.\n\nThe maximum diameter of explosives used in presplit holes shall not be greater than one-half the diameter of the presplit hole.\n\n57\n\nSection 300\n# Earthwork, Erosion Control and Drainage\n\nOnly standard cartridge explosives prepared and packaged by explosive manufacturing firms shall be used in presplit holes. These shall be fired as recommended by the manufacturer. Ammonium nitrate composition blasting agents will not be permitted in presplitting operations.\n\nStemming may be required to achieve a satisfactory presplit face. Stemming material shall be dry free-running material all of which passes 11.2 mm sieve and 90 percent of which is retained on 2.80 mm sieve. Stemmed presplit holes shall be completely filled to the collar. All charges in each presplitting pattern shall be detonated simultaneously.\n\n# 303.3 Tolerances\n\nThe presplit face shall not deviate more than 300 mm from the plane passing through adjacent drill holes, except where the character of the rock is such that, as determined by the Engineer, irregularities are unavoidable. When completed, the average plane of the slopes shall conform to the slopes indicated on the plans and no point on the completed slopes shall vary from the designated slopes by more than 300 mm. These tolerances shall be measured perpendicular to the plane of the slope. In no case shall any portion of the slope encroach on the side drains.\n\nAs long as equally satisfactory presplit slopes are obtained, then either the slope face may be presplit before drilling for production blasting or presplitting the slope face and production blasting may be done at the same time, provided that the presplitting drill holes are fired with zero delay and the production holes are delayed starting at the row of holes farthest from the slope and progressing in steps to the row of holes nearest the presplit lines, which row shall be delayed at least 50 milliseconds. In either case the presplitting holes shall extend either to the end of the excavation or for a distance of not less than 15 m beyond the limits of the production holes to be detonated.\n\n# 303.4 Measurements for Payment\n\nThe area of presplitting to be paid for, will be measured as square metres of acceptable presplit slope surface.\n\n# 303.5 Rates\n\nThe Contract unit rate for presplitting work shall be payment in full for carrying out the required operations for obtaining acceptable presplit slope surfaces. The quantity of rock excavated through the production/presplit holes shall be paid for as per Clause 301.9.1.\n\n58\n\nEarthwork, Erosion Control and Drainage\n# Section 300\n\n# 304 Excavation for Structures\n\n# 304.1 Scope\n\nExcavation for structures shall consist of the removal of material for the construction of foundations for bridges, culverts, retaining walls, headwalls, cutoff walls, pipe culverts and other similar structures, in accordance with the requirements of these Specifications and the lines and dimensions shown on the drawings or as indicated by the Engineer. The work shall include construction of the necessary cofferdams and cribs and their subsequent removal; all necessary sheeting, shoring, bracing, draining and pumping; the removal of all logs, stumps, grubs and other deleterious matter and obstruction, necessary for placing the foundations; trimming bottoms of excavations; backfilling and clearing up the site and the disposal of all surplus material.\n\n# 304.2 Classification of Excavation\n\nAll materials involved in excavation shall be classified in accordance with Clause 301.2.\n\n# 304.3 Construction Operations\n\n# 304.3.1 Setting Out\n\nAfter the site has been cleared according to Clause 201, the limits of excavation shall be set out true to lines, curves and slopes to Clause 301.3.1.\n\n# 304.3.2 Excavation\n\nExcavation shall be taken to the width of the lowest step of the footing including additional width as required for construction operation. The sides shall be left plumb where the nature of soil allows it. Where the nature of soil or the depth of the trench and season of the year do not permit vertical sides, the Contractor at his own cost shall put up necessary shoring, strutting and planking or cut slopes to a safer angle or both with due regard to the safety of personnel and works and to the satisfaction of the Engineer.\n\nThe depth to which the excavation is to be carried out shall be as shown on the drawings, unless the type of material encountered is such as to require changes, in which case the depth shall be as ordered by the Engineer. Propping shall be undertaken when any foundation or stressed zone from an adjoining structure is within a line of 1 vertical to 2 horizontal from the bottom of the excavation.\n\nWhere blasting is to be resorted-to, the same shall be carried out in accordance with Clause 302 and all precautions indicated therein observed.\n\n\n\nSection 300\n# Earthwork, Erosion Control and Drainage\n\nendanger adjoining foundations or other structures, necessary precautions such as controlled blasting, providing rubber mat cover to prevent flying of debris etc. shall be taken to prevent any damage.\n\n# 304.3.3 dewatering and protection\n\nNormally, open foundations shall be laid dry. Where water is met with in excavation due to stream flow, seepage, springs, rain or other reasons, the Contractor shall take adequate measures such as bailing, pumping, constructing diversion channels, drainage channels, bunds, depression of water level by well-point system, cofferdams and other necessary works to keep the foundation trenches dry when so required and to protect the green concrete/masonry against damage by erosion or sudden rising of water level. The methods to be adopted in this regard and other details thereof shall be left to the choice of the Contractor but subject to the approval of the Engineer. Approval of the Engineer shall, however, not relieve the Contractor of the responsibility for the adequacy of dewatering and protection arrangements for the quality and safety of the works.\n\nWhere cofferdams are required, these shall be carried to adequate depths and heights, be safely designed and constructed and be made as watertight as is necessary for facilitating construction to be carried out inside them. The interior dimensions of the cofferdams shall be such as to give sufficient clearance for the construction and inspection and to permit installation of pumping equipments, etc., inside the enclosed area.\n\nIf it is determined beforehand that the foundations cannot be laid dry or the situation is found that the percolation is too heavy for keeping the foundation dry, the foundation concrete shall be laid under water by tremie pipe only. In case of flowing water or artesian springs, the flow shall be stopped or reduced as far as possible at the time of placing the concrete.\n\nPumping from the interior of any foundation enclosure shall be done in such a manner as to preclude the possibility of the movement of water through any fresh concrete. No pumping shall be permitted during the placing of concrete and for a period of at least 24 hours thereafter, unless it is done from a suitable sump separated from the concrete work by a watertight wall or other similar means.\n\nAt the discretion of the Contractor, cement grouting or other approved methods may be used to prevent or reduce seepage and to protect the excavation area.\n\nThe Contractor shall take all precautions in diverting channels and in discharging the drained water as not to cause damage to the works, crops or any other property.\n\n# 304.3.4 preparation of foundation\n\nThe bottom of the foundation shall be levelled both longitudinally and transversely or stepped as directed by the Engineer. Before footing is laid, the surface shall be slightly watered and\n\n\n\nEarthwork, Erosion Control and Drainage\n# Section 300\n\nrammed. In the event of excavation having been made deeper than that shown on the drawings or as otherwise ordered by the Engineer, the extra depth shall be made up with concrete as per Clause 2104.1 at the cost of the Contractor. Ordinary filling shall not be permitted to bring the foundation to the design level as shown in the drawing.\n\nWhen rock or other hard strata is encountered, it shall be freed of all soft and loose material, cleaned and cut to a firm surface either level or stepped as directed by the Engineer. All seams shall be cleaned out and filled with cement mortar or grout to the satisfaction of the Engineer. In the case of excavation in rock, annular space around footing shall be filled with lean concrete M 15 upto the top level of rock.\n\nIf the depth of fill required is more than 1.5 m in soft rock or 0.6 m in hard rock above the foundation level, the filling upto this level shall be done with M-15 concrete and portion above shall be filled by concrete or by boulders grouted with cement.\n\nWhen foundation piles are used, the excavation for pile cap shall be done after driving/casting of all piles forming the group. After pile driving operations in a given pit are completed, all loose and displaced materials therein shall be removed to the level of the bottom of the pile cap.\n\n# 304.3.5 slips and slip-outs\n\nIf there are any slips or slip-outs in the excavation, these shall be removed by the Contractor at his own cost.\n\n# 304.3.6 public safety\n\nNear towns, villages and all frequented places, trenches and foundation pits shall be securely fenced, provided with proper caution signs and marked with red lights at night to avoid accidents. The Contractor shall take adequate protective measures to see that the excavation operations do not affect or damage adjoining structures. For safety precautions, guidance may be taken from IS:3764.\n\n# 304.3.7 Backfilling\n\nBackfilling shall be done with approved material after concrete or masonry is fully set and carried out in such a way as not to cause undue thrust on any part of the structure. All space between foundation masonry or concrete and the sides of excavation shall be refilled to the original surface in layers not exceeding 150 mm compacted thickness. The compaction shall be done with the help of suitable equipment such as trench compactor, mechanical tamper, rammer, plate vibrator etc., after necessary watering, so as to achieve the maximum dry density.\n\n61\n\nSection 300\n# Earthwork, Erosion Control and Drainage\n\n# 304.3.8 Disposal of Surplus Excavated Materials\n\nClause 301.3.11 shall apply.\n\n# 304.4 Measurements for Payment\n\nExcavation for structures shall be measured in cu.m for each class of material encountered, limited to the dimensions shown on the drawings or as directed by the Engineer.

If permitted by the Engineer, these shall not be dug continuously. Ridges of not less than 8 m width should be left at intervals not exceeding 300 m. Small drains shall be cut through the ridges to facilitate drainage. The depth of the pits shall be so regulated that their bottom does not cut an imaginary line having a slope of 1 vertical to 4 horizontal projected from the edge of the final section of the bank, the maximum depth in any case being limited to 1.5 m. Also, no pit shall be dug within the offset width of a minimum of 10 m.\n\nHaulage of material to embankments or other areas of fill shall proceed only when sufficient spreading and compaction plant is operating at the place of deposition.\n\nWhere the excavation reveals a combination of acceptable and unacceptable materials, the Contractor shall, unless otherwise agreed by the Engineer, carry out the excavation in such a manner that the acceptable materials are excavated separately for use in the permanent works without contamination by the unacceptable materials. The acceptable materials shall be stockpiled separately.\n\nThe Contractor shall ensure that he does not adversely affect the stability of excavation or fills by the methods of stockpiling materials, use of plants or siting of temporary buildings or structures.\n\n65\n\nSection 300\n# Earthwork, Erosion Control and Drainage\n\n# 305.2.2.3 fly-ash\n\nUse of fly-ash shall conform to the Ministry of Environment and Forest guidelines.

The values of maximum dry density and optimum moisture content obtained in accordance with IS:2720 (Part 8), appropriate for each of the fill materials he intends to use.\n2. A graph of dry density plotted against moisture content from which each of the values in (i) above of maximum dry density and optimum moisture content were determined.\n\n66\n\nEarthwork, Erosion Control and Drainage\n# Section 300\n\nThe maximum dry density and optimum moisture content approved by the Engineer shall form the basis for compaction.\n\n# 305.3 construction operations\n\n# 305.3.1 setting out\n\nAfter the site has been cleared to Clause 201, the work shall be set out to Clause 301.3.1 The limits of embankment/sub-grade shall be marked by fixing batter pegs on both sides at regular intervals as guides before commencing the earthwork. The embankment/sub-grade shall be built sufficiently wider than the design dimension so that surplus material may be trimmed, ensuring that the remaining material is to the desired density and in position specified and conforms to the specified side slopes.\n\n# 305.3.2 dewatering\n\nIf the foundation of the embankment is in an area with stagnant water, and in the opinion of the Engineer it is feasible to remove it, the same shall be removed by bailing out or pumping, as directed by the Engineer and the area of the embankment foundation shall be kept dry. Care shall be taken to discharge the drained water so as not to cause damage to the works, crops or any other property. Due to any negligence on the part of the Contractor, if any such damage is caused, it shall be the sole responsibility of the Contractor to repair/restore it to original condition or compensate for the damage at his own cost. If the embankment is to be constructed under water, Clause 305.4.6 shall apply.\n\n# 305.3.3 stripping and storing topsoil\n\nWhen so directed by the Engineer, the topsoil from all areas of cutting and from all areas to be covered by embankment foundation shall be stripped to specified depths not exceeding 150 mm and stored in stockpiles of height not exceeding 2 m for covering embankment slopes, cut slopes and other disturbed areas where re-vegetation is desired. Topsoil shall not be unnecessarily subjected to traffic either before stripping or when in a stockpile. Stockpiles shall not be surcharged or otherwise loaded and multiple handling shall be kept to a minimum.\n\n# 305.3.4 compacting ground supporting embankment/sub-grade\n\nWhere necessary, the original ground shall be levelled to facilitate placement of first layer of embankment, scarified, mixed with water and then compacted by rolling in accordance with Clauses 305.3.5 and 305.3.6 so as to achieve minimum dry density as given in Table 300-2.\n\n67\n\n\n\nSection 300\n\n# Earthwork, Erosion Control and Drainage\n\nIn case where the difference between the sub-grade level (top of the sub-grade on which pavement rests) and ground level is less than 0.5 m and the ground does not have 97 percent relative compaction with respect to the dry density (as given in Table 300-2), the ground shall be loosened upto a level 0.5 m below the sub-grade level, watered and compacted in layers in accordance with Clauses 305.3.5 and 305.3.6 to achieve dry density not less than 97 percent relative compaction as given in Table 300-2.\n\nWhere so directed by the Engineer, any unsuitable material occurring in the embankment foundation (500 mm portion just below the sub-grade) shall be removed, suitably disposed and replaced by approved materials laid in layers to the required degree of compaction. Any foundation treatment specified for embankments especially high embankments, resting on suspect foundations as revealed by borehole logs shall be carried out in a manner and to the depth as desired by the Engineer. Where the ground on which an embankment is to be built has any of such material types (a) to (f) in Clause 305.2.1.1 at least 500 mm of such material must be removed and replaced by acceptable fill material before embankment construction commences.\n\n# 305.3.5 Spreading Material in Layers and Bringing to Appropriate Moisture Content\n\n# 305.3.5.1\n\nThe embankment and sub-grade material shall be spread in layers of uniform thickness in the entire width with a motor grader. The compacted thickness of each layer shall not be more than 250 mm when vibratory roller/vibratory soil compactor is used and not more than 200 mm when 80-100 kN static roller is used. The motor grader blade shall have hydraulic control suitable for initial adjustment and maintain the same so as to achieve the specific slope and grade. Successive layers shall not be placed until the layer under construction has been thoroughly compacted to the specified requirements as in Table 300-2 and got approved by the Engineer. Each compacted layer shall be finished parallel to the final cross-section of the embankment.\n\n# 305.3.5.2\n\nMoisture content of the material shall be checked at the site of placement prior to commencement of compaction; if found to be out of agreed limits, the same shall be made good. Where water is required to be added in such constructions, water shall be sprinkled from a water tanker fitted with sprinkler capable of applying water uniformly with a controllable rate of flow to variable widths of surface but without any flooding. The water shall be added uniformly and thoroughly mixed in soil by blading, using disc harrow until a uniform moisture content is obtained throughout the depth of the layer.\n\nIf the material delivered to the roadbed is too wet, it shall be dried, by aeration and exposure to the sun, till the moisture content is acceptable for compaction. Should circumstances arise, where owing to wet weather, the moisture content cannot be reduced to the required amount by the above procedure, compaction work shall be suspended.\n\n68\n\nEarthwork, Erosion Control and Drainage\n# Section 300\n\nMoisture content of each layer of soil shall be checked in accordance with IS:2720 (Part 2), and unless otherwise mentioned, shall be so adjusted, making due allowance for evaporation losses, that at the time of compaction it is in the range of 1 percent above to 2 percent below the optimum moisture content determined in accordance with IS:2720 (Part 8) as the case may be. Expansive clays shall, however, be compacted at moisture content corresponding to the specified dry density, but on the wet side of the optimum moisture content obtained from the laboratory compaction curve.\n\nAfter adding the required amount of water, the soil shall be processed by means of graders, harrows, rotary mixers or as otherwise approved by the Engineer until the layer is uniformly wet.\n\nClods or hard lumps of earth shall be broken to have a maximum size of 75 mm when being placed in the embankment and a maximum size of 50 mm when being placed in the sub-grade.\n\n# 305.3.5.3\n\nEmbankment and other areas of fill shall, unless otherwise required in the Contract or permitted by the Engineer, be constructed evenly over their full width and their fullest possible extent and the Contractor shall control and direct construction plant and other construction vehicles. Damage by construction plant and other vehicular traffic shall be made good by the Contractor with material having the same characteristics and strength of the material before it was damaged.\n\nEmbankments and unsupported fills shall not be constructed with steeper side slopes or to greater widths than those shown in the drawings, except to permit adequate compaction at the edges before trimming back, or to obtain the final profile following any settlement of the fill and the underlying material.\n\nWhenever fill is to be deposited against the face of a natural slope, or sloping earthworks face including embankments, cuttings, other fills and excavations steeper than 1 vertical to 4 horizontal, such faces shall be benched as per Clause 305.4.1 immediately before placing the subsequent fill.\n\nAll permanent faces of side slopes of embankments and other areas of fill shall, subsequent to any trimming operations, be reworked and sealed to the satisfaction of the Engineer by tracking a tracked vehicle, considered suitable by the Engineer, on the slope or any other method approved by the Engineer.\n\n# 305.3.6\n\n# compaction\n\nOnly the compaction equipment approved by the Engineer shall be employed to compact the different material types encountered during construction. Static three-wheeled roller, self propelled single drum vibratory roller, tandem vibratory roller, pneumatic tyre roller, pad foot\n\n69\n\nSection 300\n# Earthwork, Erosion Control and Drainage\n\nroller, etc., of suitable size and capacity as approved by the Engineer shall be used for the different types and grades of materials required to be compacted either individually or in suitable combinations.\n\nThe compaction shall be done with the help of self-propelled single drum vibratory roller or pad foot vibratory roller of 80 to 100 kN static weight or heavy pneumatic tyre roller of adequate capacity capable of achieving the required compaction. The Contractor shall demonstrate the efficacy of the equipment he intends to use by carrying out compaction trials. The procedure to be adopted for the site trials shall be submitted to the Engineer for approval.\n\nEarthmoving plant shall not be accepted as compaction equipment nor shall the use of a lighter category of plant to provide any preliminary compaction to assist the use of heavier plant be taken into account.\n\nEach layer of the material shall be thoroughly compacted to the densities specified in Table 300-2. Subsequent layers shall be placed only after the finished layer has been tested according to Clause 903.2.2 and accepted by the Engineer. The Engineer may permit measurement of field dry density by a nuclear moisture/density gauge used in accordance with agreed procedure and provided the gauge is calibrated to give results identical to that obtained from tests in accordance with IS:2720 (Part 28). A record of the same shall be maintained by the Contractor.\n\nWhen density measurements reveal any soft areas in the embankment/sub-grade/earthen shoulders, further compaction shall be carried out as directed by the Engineer. If inspite of that the specified compaction is not achieved, the material in the soft areas shall be removed and replaced by approved material, compacted using appropriate mechanical means such as light weight vibratory roller, double drum walk behind roller, vibratory plate compactor, trench compactor or vibratory tamper to the density requirements and satisfaction of the Engineer.\n\n# 305.3.7 drainage\n\nThe surface of the embankment/sub-grade at all times during construction shall be maintained at such a crossfall (not flatter than that required for effective drainage of an earthen surface) as will shed water and prevent ponding.\n\n# 305.3.8 repairing of damages caused by rain/spillage of water\n\nThe soil in the affected portion shall be removed in such areas as directed by the Engineer before next layer is laid and refilled in layers and compacted using appropriate mechanical means such as small vibratory roller, plate compactor or power rammer to achieve the required density in accordance with Clause 305.3.6. If the cut is not sufficiently wide for use of required mechanical means for compaction, the same shall be widened suitably to permit their use for proper compaction. Tests shall be carried out as directed by the Engineer to\n\n70\n\nEarthwork, Erosion Control and Drainage\n# Section 300\n\nascertain the density requirements of the repaired area. The work of repairing the damages including widening of the cut, if any, shall be carried out by the Contractor at his own cost, including the arranging of machinery/equipment for the purpose.\n\n# 305.3.9 finishing operations\n\nFinishing operations shall include the work of shaping and dressing the shoulders/verge/roadbed and side slopes to conform to the alignment, levels, cross-sections and dimensions shown on the drawings or as directed by the Engineer subject to the surface tolerance described in Clause 902. Both the upper and lower ends of the side slopes shall be rounded off to improve appearance and to merge the embankment with the adjacent terrain.\n\nThe topsoil, removed and conserved earlier (Clauses 301.3.2 and 305.3.3) shall be spread over the fill slopes as per directions of the Engineer to facilitate the growth of vegetation. Slopes shall be roughened and moistened slightly prior to the application of the topsoil in order to provide satisfactory bond. The depth of the topsoil shall be sufficient to sustain plant growth, the usual thickness being from 75 mm to 150 mm.\n\nWhere directed, the slopes shall be turfed with sods in accordance with Clause 307. If seeding and mulching of slopes is prescribed, this shall be done to the requirements of Clause 308. When earthwork operations have been substantially completed, the road area shall be cleared of all debris, and ugly scars in the construction area responsible for objectionable appearance eliminated.\n\n# 305.4 construction of embankment and sub-grade under special conditions\n\n# 305.4.1 earthwork for widening existing road embankment\n\nWhen an existing embankment and/or sub-grade is to be widened and its slopes are steeper than 1 vertical on 4 horizontal, continuous horizontal benches, each at least 300 mm wide, shall be cut into the old slope for ensuring adequate bond with the fresh embankment/sub-grade material to be added. The material obtained from cutting of benches could be utilized in the widening of the embankment/subgrade. However, when the existing slope against which the fresh material is to be placed is flatter than 1 vertical on 4 horizontal, the slope surface may only be ploughed or scarified instead of resorting to benching.\n\nWhere the width of the widened portions is insufficient to permit the use of conventional rollers, compaction shall be carried out with the help of light weight vibratory roller, double drum walk behind roller, vibratory plate compactor or vibratory tamper or any other appropriate equipment approved by the Engineer. End dumping of material from trucks for widening operations shall be avoided except in difficult circumstances when the extra width is too narrow to permit the movement of any other types of hauling equipment.\n\n\n\nSection 300\n# Earthwork, Erosion Control and Drainage\n\n# 305.4.2 earthwork for embankment and sub-grade to be placed against sloping ground\n\nWhere an embankment/subgrade is to be placed against sloping ground, the latter shall be appropriately benched or ploughed/scarified as required in Clause 305.4.1 before placing the embankment/sub-grade material. Extra earthwork involved in benching or due to ploughing/scarifying etc. shall be considered incidental to the work.\n\nFor wet conditions, benches with slightly inward fall and subsoil drains at the lowest point shall be provided as per the drawings, before the fill is placed against sloping ground.\n\nWhere the Contract requires construction of transverse subsurface drain at the cut-fill interface, work on the same shall be carried out to Clause 309 in proper sequence with the embankment and sub-grade work as approved by the Engineer.\n\n# 305.4.3 earthwork over existing road surface\n\nWhere the embankment is to be placed over an existing road surface, the work shall be carried out as indicated below:\n\n1. If the existing road surface is of granular type and lies within 1 m of the new formation levels, it shall be scarified to a depth of 50 mm or as directed so as to provide ample bond between the old and new material ensuring that at least 500 mm portion below the top of new sub-grade level is compacted to the desired density;\n2. If the existing road surface is of bituminous type or cement concrete and lies within 1 m of the new formation level, the bituminous or cement concrete layer shall be removed completely;\n3. If the level difference between the existing road surface and the new formation level is more than 1 m, the existing surface shall be roughened after ensuring that the minimum thickness of 500 mm of subgrade is available.\n\n# 305.4.4 embankment and sub-grade around structures\n\nTo avoid interference with the construction of abutments, wing walls or return walls of culvert/bridge structures, the Contractor shall, at points, to be determined by the Engineer suspend work on embankment forming approaches to such structures, until such time as the construction of the latter is sufficiently advanced to permit the completion of approaches without the risk of damage to the structure.\n\nUnless directed otherwise, the filling around culverts, bridges and other structures up to a distance of twice the height of the road from the back of the abutment shall be carried out.\n\n72\n\nEarthwork, Erosion Control and Drainage\n# Section 300\n\nindependent of the work on the main embankment. The fill material shall not be placed against any abutment or wing wall, unless permission has been given by the Engineer but in any case not until the concrete or masonry has been in position for 14 days. The embankment and sub-grade shall be brought up simultaneously in equal layers on each side of the structure to avoid displacement and unequal pressure. The sequence of work in this regard shall be got approved from the Engineer.\n\nThe material used for backfill shall not be an organic soil or highly plastic clay having plasticity index and liquid limit more than 20 and 40 respectively when tested according to IS:2720 (Part 5). Filling behind abutments and wing walls for all structures shall conform to the general guidelines given in IRC:78. The fill material shall be deposited in horizontal layers in loose thickness and compacted thoroughly to the requirements of Table 300-2.\n\nWhere the provision of any filter medium is specified behind the abutment, the same shall be laid in layers simultaneously with the laying of fill material. The material used for filter shall conform to the requirements for filter medium spelt out in Clause 2504 unless otherwise specified in the Contract.\n\nWhere it may be impracticable to use conventional rollers, the compaction shall be carried out by appropriate mechanical means such as small vibratory roller, plate compactor or power rammer. Care shall be taken to see that the compaction equipment does not hit or come too close to any structural member so as to cause any damage to them or excessive pressure against the structure.\n\n# 305.4.5 construction of embankment over ground incapable of supporting construction equipment\n\nWhere embankment is to be constructed across ground which will not support the weight of repeated heavy loads of construction equipment, the first layer of the fill may be constructed by placing successive loads of material in a uniformly distributed layer of a minimum thickness required to support the construction equipment as permitted by the Engineer. The Contractor, if so desired by him, may also use suitable geosynthetic material to increase the bearing capacity of the foundation. This exception to normal procedure will not be permitted where, in the opinion of the Engineer, the embankments could be constructed in the approved manner over such ground by the use of lighter or modified equipment after proper ditching and drainage have been provided. Where this exception is permitted, the selection of the material and the construction procedure to obtain an acceptable layer shall be the responsibility of the Contractor. The cost of providing suitable traffic conditions for construction equipment over any area of the Contract will be the responsibility of the Contractor and no extra payment will be made to him. The remainder of the embankment shall be constructed as specified in Clause 305.3.\n\n73\n\nSection 300\n# Earthwork, Erosion Control and Drainage\n\n# 305.4.6 embankment construction under water and waterlogged areas\n\n# 305.4.6.1 embankment construction under water\n\nWhere filling or backfilling is to be placed under water, only acceptable granular material or rock shall be used unless otherwise approved by the Engineer.

Turning of vehicles shall not be permitted on the first lift above the geotextile.\n\nEarthwork, Erosion Control and Drainage\n# Section 300\n\nc) seaming: A sewn seam is to be used for the seaming of the geotextile. The thread used shall consist of high strength polypropylene or polyester. Nylon thread shall not be used. The thread shall also be resistant to ultraviolet radiation. The thread shall be of contrasting color to that of the geotextile itself. For seams which are sewn in the field, the Contractor shall provide at least a 2 m length sewn seam for sampling by the Engineer before the geo-textile is installed. For seams which are sewn in the factory, the Engineer shall obtain samples of the factory seams at random from any roll of geotextile which is used on the project. For seams that are field sewn, the seams sewn for sampling shall be sewn using the same equipment and procedures as will be used for the production seams.

The seam assembly description shall be submitted by the Contractor along with the sample of the seam. The description shall include the seam type, stitch type, sewing thread and stitch density.\n\nv) addition of surcharge: Addition of surcharge load by approved embankment material shall be placed over the geotextile layer up to a height as per the design requirement. The addition of surcharge shall be placed with adequate side slope to avoid any slope failure. The addition of surcharge shall be kept in place for a period as per the design to achieve desired degree of consolidation. After ascertaining that the desired degree of consolidation is achieved, the addition of surcharge which is not forming part of permanent work/embankment shall be removed to the required level as per drawings. Removal of additional surcharge material shall be done without damaging the road embankment. After removal of additional surcharge, the damaged embankment top, if any, shall be made good as instructed by the Engineer. The addition and removal of surcharge shall be incidental to the work except for payment of additional surcharge quantity forming part of permanent embankment. The quantity for payment will be determined based on the settlements readings observed through instrumentation.\n\nvi) instrumentation and Monitoring the Behaviour of sub-soil/embankment: Monitoring the behavior of the sub-soil/embankment construction shall form part of the work. The design shall be based on the gain in the shear strength of the subsoil due to consolidation process. The following critical parameters shall be monitored:\n\n- a) Monitoring the Build up and dissipation of pore pressure: Casagrande open standpipe type piezometers shall be used for\n\n95\n\nSection 300\n# Earthwork, Erosion Control and Drainage\n\nThe measurement of changes in pore pressure. The specifications for the Casagrande piezometer shall be as follows.\n\n- The piezometer shall be 38 mm in dia and 300 mm in length;\n- The air entry value shall be of the order of 0.3 kg/cm\u00b2.\n- The standpipe shall be more than 16 mm in diameter;\n- The piezometer shall be installed in 150 mm borehole, at specified depths.

These shall be installed at locations specified by the Engineer. The readings of settlement gauges also form the basis to estimate the quantity of surcharge forming part of permanent work. The number of settlement gauges shall be decided by the Engineer keeping in view this aspect.\n\n# c) Measurement of shear strength:\n\nThe shear strength parameters of the subsoil [unconfined compressive strength (UCS)] shall be measured at locations specified by the Engineer at the end of each stage of surcharge loading in order to compare the actual details with the design assumptions. For the recovery of undisturbed samples from the subsoil for determining UCS, before the start of construction of surcharge, 100 mm dia casing pipe shall be installed into the ground to 3 m depth, preferably by driving; the top of the casing pipe shall have provision for adding extensions.\n\n\n\n# Earthwork, Erosion Control and Drainage\n\n# Section 300\n\nat top by screw coupling; and as the surcharge construction proceeds the casing pipe shall be extended. This procedure ensures avoiding drilling through the surcharge already placed as well as any damage to the installed band drains. Undisturbed samples (UDS) are recovered and UCS is determined in the site laboratory (sending UDS sample to distant laboratories would result in loss of water content and disturbance of the samples leading to erroneous values of UCS). Undisturbed samples shall be recovered at every 1.5 m depth at the specified locations, so that complete strength profile of subsoil is obtained.\n\n1. During the placing of the surcharge and compaction, the Contractor shall take utmost care so that the monitoring instruments are not damaged. Compaction by small vibratory rollers shall be done for 1.5 m around the monitoring instruments and bigger rollers shall not be used near the monitoring instruments. Similarly care shall be taken that movement of dumpers does not damage the monitoring instruments.\n2. frequency of observations: The readings of the piezometers and the settlement gauges shall be recorded at the following frequency.\n1. Daily reading shall be taken in stretches where filling/ surcharge operations are in progress. Weekly readings shall be taken in stretches, where no filling/ surcharge is being done.\n2. Weekly readings shall be taken after the desired fill/ surcharge height is achieved, till the next stage filling commences. All data shall be recorded in a register and maintained properly.\n3. The Data from the monitoring instruments provides the background for regulating the rate of placing the fill/ surcharge as well as the waiting period between stages.\n3. precautions against pilferage: The observation data shall be recorded during construction and for three months thereafter. It is therefore essential that the instruments are not tampered and stolen. Suitable precautions shall be taken in this regard by the Contractor.\n4. drainage of ground water: The water which will come out from the subsoil through vertical drains will be accumulated at temporary ditches to be dug at nearby areas and the accumulated water will be dewatered regularly from the ditches to the outfalls as directed by the Engineer.\n5.

The quantity of lime used shall be related to its calcium oxide content which shall be specified. Where the lime of different calcium oxide content is to be used, its quantity shall be suitably adjusted with the approval of the Engineer so that equivalent calcium oxide is incorporated in the work. The mix design shall be done to arrive at the appropriate quantity of lime to be added, having due regard to the purity of lime, the type of soil, the moisture-density relationship, and the design CBR/Unconfined Compressive Strength (UCS) value specified in the Contract.

Manual mixing shall be permitted only where the width of laying is not adequate for mechanical operations, as in small-sized jobs.\n\nThe equipment used for mix-in-place construction shall be a rotavator or similar approved equipment capable of pulverizing and mixing the soil with additive and water to specified degree to the full thickness of the layer being processed, and of achieving the desired degree of mixing and uniformity of the stabilized material. If so desired by the Engineer, trial runs with the equipment shall be carried out to establish its suitability for work.\n\nThe thickness of any layer to be stabilized shall be not less than 100 mm when compacted. The maximum thickness can be 200 mm, provided the plant used is accepted by the Engineer.\n\n# 402.3.4 Mix-in-place Method of construction\n\nBefore deploying the equipment, the soil after it is made free of undesirable vegetation or other deleterious matter shall be spread uniformly on the prepared subgrade in a quantity sufficient to achieve the desired compacted thickness of the stabilised layer. Where single-pass equipment is to be employed, the soil shall be lightly rolled as directed by the Engineer.\n\n113\n\nSection 400\n# Sub-Bases, Bases (Non-Bituminous) and Shoulders\n\nThe equipment used shall either be of single-pass or multiple pass type. The mixers shall be equipped with an appropriate device for controlling the depth of processing and the mixing blades shall be maintained or reset periodically so that the correct depth of mixing is obtained at all times.\n\nWith single-pass equipment the forward speed of the machine shall be so selected in relation to the rotor speed that the required degree of mixing, pulverisation and depth of processing is obtained. In multiple-pass processing, the prepared sub-grade shall be pulverised to the required depth with successive passes of the equipment and the moisture content adjusted to be within prescribed limits mentioned hereinafter. The lime shall then be spread uniformly and mixing continued with successive passes until the required depth and uniformity of processing have been obtained.\n\nThe mixing equipment shall be so set that it cuts slightly into the edge of the adjoining lane processed previously so as to ensure that all the material forming a layer has been properly processed for the full width.\n\n# 402.3.5 construction with Manual Means\n\nWhere manual mixing is permitted, the soil from borrow areas shall first be freed of all vegetation and other deleterious mater and placed on the prepared subgrade. The soil shall then be pulverized by means of crow-bars, pick axes or other means approved by the Engineer.\n\nWater in requisite quantities may be sprinkled on the soil for aiding pulverisation. On the pulverized soil, the lime in requisite quantities shall be spread uniformly and mixed thoroughly by working with spades or other similar implements till the whole mass is uniform. After adjusting the moisture content to be within the limits mentioned later, the mixed material shall be leveled up to the required thickness so that it is ready to be rolled.\n\n# 402.3.6 addition of lime\n\nLime may be mixed with the prepared material either in slurry form or dry state at the option of the Contractor with the approval of the Engineer.\n\nDry lime shall be prevented from blowing by adding water to the lime or other suitable means selected by the Contractor, with the approval of the Engineer.\n\nThe tops of windrowed material may be flattened or slightly trenched to receive the lime. The distance to which lime may be spread upon the prepared material ahead of the mixing operation shall be determined by the Engineer.\n\n114\n\nSub-Bases, Bases (Non-Bituminous) and Shoulders\n# Section 400\n\nNo traffic other than the mixing equipment shall be allowed to pass over the spread lime until after completion of mixing.\n\nMixing or remixing operations, regardless of equipment used, shall continue until the material is free of any white streaks or pockets of lime and the mixture is uniform.\n\nNon-uniformity of colour reaction, when the treated material is tested with the standard phenolphthalein alcohol indicator, will be considered evidence of inadequate mixing.\n\n# 402.3.7 Moisture content for compaction\n\nThe moisture content at compaction checked vide IS:2720 (Part 2) shall neither be less than the optimum moisture content corresponding to IS:2720 (Part 8) nor more than 2 percent above it.\n\n# 402.3.8 Rolling\n\nImmediately after spreading, grading and levelling of the mixed material, compaction shall be carried out with approved equipment preceded by a few passes of lighter rollers if necessary.\n\nRolling shall commence at edges and progress towards the centre, except at super elevated portions or for carriageway with unidirectional cross-fall where it shall commence at the inner edge and progress towards the outer edge. During rolling, the surface shall be frequently checked for grade and crossfall (camber) and any irregularities corrected by loosening the material and removing/adding fresh material. Compaction shall continue until the density achieved is at least 98 percent of the maximum dry density for the material determined in accordance with IS:2720 (Part 8).\n\nCare shall be taken to see that the compaction of lime stabilised material is completed within three hours of its mixing or such shorter period as may be found necessary in dry weather. During rolling it shall be ensured that roller does not bear directly on hardened or partially hardened treated material previously laid other than what may be necessary for achieving the specified compaction at the joint. The final surface shall be well closed, free from movement under compaction planes, ridges, cracks or loose material. All loose or segregated or otherwise defective areas shall be made good to the full thickness of the layer and recompacted.\n\n# 402.3.9 Curing\n\nThe sub-base course shall be suitably cured for a minimum period of 7 days after which subsequent pavement courses shall be laid to prevent the surface from drying out and becoming friable. No traffic of any kind shall ply over the completed sub-base unless permitted by the Engineer.\n\n115\n\nSection 400 - Sub-Bases, Bases (Non-Bituminous) and Shoulders\n\n# 402.4 Surface Finish and Quality Control of Work\n\nThe surface finish of construction shall conform to the requirements of Clause 902. Control on the quality of materials and works shall be exercised by the Engineer in accordance with Section 900.\n\n# 402.5 Strength\n\nWhen lime is used for improving the subgrade, the soil-lime mix shall be tested for its CBR value.

Any ruts or soft yielding places shall be corrected in an approved manner and rolled until firm surface is obtained.\n\nWhere the WBM is to be laid on an existing metalled road, damaged area including depressions and potholes shall be repaired and made good with the suitable material. The existing surface shall be scarified and re-shaped to the required grade and camber before spreading the coarse aggregate for WBM.\n\nAs far as possible, laying water bound macadam course over existing bituminous layer may be avoided since it will cause problems of internal drainage of the pavement at the interface of two courses. It is desirable to completely pick out the existing thin bituminous wearing course where water bound macadam is proposed to be laid over it.\n\n# 404.3.2 inverted choke/sub-surface drainage layer\n\nIf water bound macadam is to be laid directly over the sub-grade, without any other intervening pavement course, a 25 mm course of screenings (Grading B) or coarse sand shall be spread on the prepared sub-grade before application of the aggregates is taken up. In case of a fine sand or silty or clayey sub-grade, it is advisable to lay 100 mm insulating layer of screening or coarse sand on top of fine grained soil, the gradation of which will depend upon whether it is intended to act as a drainage layer as well. As a preferred alternative to inverted choke, appropriate geosynthetics performing functions of separation and drainage may be used over the prepared sub-grade as directed by the Engineer. Section 700 shall be applicable for use of geosynthetics.\n\n# 404.3.3 Lateral Confinement of Aggregates\n\nFor construction of WBM, arrangement shall be made for the lateral confinement of aggregates. This shall be done by building adjoining shoulders along with WBM layers. The practice of constructing WBM in a trench section excavated in the finished formation must be completely avoided.\n\nWhere the WBM course is to be constructed in narrow widths for widening of an existing pavement, the existing shoulders should be excavated to their full depth and width up to the sub-grade level except where widening specifications envisages laying of a stablised sub-base using in-situ operations in which case the same should be removed only up to the sub-base level.\n\n125\n\nSection 400\n# Sub-Bases, Bases (Non-Bituminous) and Shoulders\n\n# 404.3.4 Spreading Coarse Aggregates\n\nThe coarse aggregates shall be spread uniformly and evenly upon the prepared sub-grade/sub-base in the required quantities from the stockpiles to proper profile by using templates placed across the road about 6 m apart, in such quantities that the thickness of each compacted layer is not more than 75 mm. In no case shall these be dumped in heaps directly on the area where these are to be laid nor shall their hauling over a partly completed base be permitted. Wherever possible, approved mechanical devices such as aggregate spreader shall be used to spread the aggregates uniformly so as to minimize the need for manual rectification afterwards.\n\nNo segregation of coarse aggregates shall be allowed and the coarse aggregates, as spread shall be of uniform gradation with no pockets of fine material.\n\nThe surface of the aggregates spread shall be carefully checked with templates and all high or low spots remedied by removing or adding aggregates as may be required. The surface shall be checked frequently with a straight edge while spreading and rolling so as to ensure a finished surface as per approved drawings.\n\nThe coarse aggregates shall not normally be spread more than 3 days in advance of the subsequent construction operations.\n\n# 404.3.5 Rolling\n\nImmediately following the spreading of the coarse aggregates, rolling shall be started with three wheeled power rollers of 80 to 100 kN capacity or tandem or vibratory rollers of 80 to 100 kN static weight. The type of roller to be used shall be approved by the Engineer based on trial run.\n\nExcept on superelevated portions and carriageway with unidirectional cross-fall, where the rolling shall proceed from inner edge to the outer, rolling shall begin from the edges gradually progressing towards the center. First the edge/edges shall be compacted with roller running forward and backward. The roller shall then move inward parallel to the center line of the road, in successive passes uniformly overlapping preceding tracks by at least one-half width.\n\nRolling shall be carried out on courses where coarse aggregates of crushed/broken stone are used, till the road metal is partially compacted. This will be followed by application of screenings and binding material where required in Clauses 404.3.6 and 404.3.7.\n\nHowever, where screenings are not to be applied as in the case of aggregates like brick metal, laterite and Kankar for sub-base construction, the compaction shall be continued until the aggregates are thoroughly keyed. Rolling shall be continued and light sprinkling of water shall be done till the surface is well compacted. Rolling shall not be done when the sub-\n\n\n\nSub-Bases, Bases (Non-Bituminous) and Shoulders\n# Section 400\n\ngrade is soft or yielding or when it causes a wave-like motion in the sub-grade or sub-base course.\n\nThe rolled surface shall be checked transversely with templates and longitudinally with 3 m straight edge. Any irregularities, exceeding 12 mm, shall be corrected by loosening the surface, adding or removing necessary amount of aggregates and re-rolling until the entire surface conforms to the desired camber and grade. In no case shall the use of screenings be permitted to make up depressions.\n\nMaterial, which gets crushed excessively during compaction or becomes segregated, shall be removed and replaced with suitable aggregates.\n\n# 404.3.6 application of screenings\n\nAfter the coarse aggregates have been rolled to Clause 404.3.5, screenings to completely fill the interstices shall be applied gradually over the surface. These shall not be damp or wet at the time of application. Dry rolling shall be done while the screenings are being spread so that vibrations of the roller cause them to settle into the voids of the coarse aggregates. The screenings shall not be dumped in piles but be spread uniformly in successive thin layers either by the spreading motions of hand shovels or by mechanical spreaders, or directly from tipper with suitable grit spreading arrangement. Tipper operating for spreading the screenings shall be equipped with pneumatic tyres and operated so as not to disturb the coarse aggregates.\n\nThe screenings shall be applied at a slow and uniform rate (in three or more applications) so as to ensure filling of all voids. This shall be accompanied by dry rolling and brooming with mechanical brooms, hand brooms or both. In no case shall the screenings be applied so fast and thick as to form cakes or ridges on the surface in such a manner as would prevent filling of voids or prevent the direct bearing of the roller on the coarse aggregates. These operations shall continue until no more screenings can be forced into voids of the coarse aggregates.\n\nThe spreading, rolling, and brooming of screenings shall be carried out in only such lengths of the road which could be completed within one day\u2019s operation.\n\n# 404.3.7 sprinkling of water and grouting\n\nAfter application of screenings, the surface shall be copiously sprinkled with water, swept and rolled. Hand brooms shall be used to sweep the wet screenings into voids and to distribute them evenly. The sprinkling, sweeping and rolling operation shall be continued, with additional screenings applied as necessary until the coarse aggregates have been thoroughly keyed, well-bonded and firmly set in its full depth and a grout has been formed of screenings. Care shall be taken to see that the sub-base or sub-grade does not get damaged due to the addition of excessive quantities of water during construction.\n\n127\n\nSection 400\n# Sub-Bases, Bases (Non-Bituminous) and Shoulders\n\nIn case of lime treated soil sub-base, construction of water bound macadam on top of it shall be taken up after curing as per Clause 402.3.9 and as directed by the Engineer.\n\n# application of binding material\n\nAfter the application of screenings in accordance with Clauses 404.3.6 and 404.3.7, the binding material where it is required to be used (Clause 404.2.7) shall be applied successively in two or more thin layers at a slow and uniform rate. After each application, the surface shall be copiously sprinkled with water, the resulting slurry swept in with hand brooms, or mechanical brooms to fill the voids properly, and rolled during which water shall be applied to the wheels of the rollers if necessary to wash down the binding material sticking to them. These operations shall continue until the resulting slurry after filling of voids, forms a wave ahead of the wheels of the moving roller.\n\n# 404.3.8 setting and drying\n\nAfter the final compaction of water bound macadam course, the pavement shall be allowed to dry overnight. Next morning hungry spots shall be filled with screenings or binding material as directed, lightly sprinkled with water if necessary and rolled. No traffic shall be allowed on the road until the macadam has set. The Engineer shall have the discretion to stop hauling traffic from using the completed water bound macadam course, if in his opinion it would cause excessive damage to the surface.\n\nThe compacted water bound macadam course shall be allowed to completely dry and set before the next pavement course is laid over it.\n\n# 404.4 surface finish and Quality control of work\n\n# 404.4.1\n\nThe surface finish of construction shall conform to the requirements of Clause 902.\n\n# 404.4.2\n\nControl on the quality of materials and works shall be exercised by the Engineer in accordance with Section 900.\n\n# 404.4.3\n\nThe water bound macadam work shall not be carried out when the atmospheric temperature is less than 10\u00b0C in the shade.\n\n# 404.4.4 reconstruction of defective Macadam\n\nThe finished surface of water bound macadam shall conform to the tolerances of surface regularity as prescribed in Clause 902. However, where the surface irregularity of the course exceeds the tolerances or where the course is otherwise defective due to sub-grade soil mixing with the aggregates, the course to its full thickness shall be scarified over the affected area, reshaped with added material or removed and replaced with fresh material as applicable and re-compacted. The area treated shall not be less than 10 sq.m. In no case shall depressions be filled up with screenings or binding material.\n\n128\n\nSub-Bases, Bases (Non-Bituminous) and Shoulders\n# Section 400\n\n# 404.5 Arrangements for Traffic\n\nDuring the period of construction, the arrangements for traffic shall be done as per Clause 112.\n\n# 404.6 Measurements for payment\n\nWater bound macadam shall be measured as finished work in position in cubic metres.\n\n# 404.7 Rate\n\nThe Contract unit rate for water bound macadam sub-base/base course shall be payable in full for carrying out the required operations including full compensation for all components listed in Clause 401.7 (i) to (v), including arrangement of water used in the work as approved by the Engineer.\n\n# 405 Crushed Cement Concrete Sub-Base\n\n# 405.1 Scope\n\nThis work shall consist of breaking and crushing the damaged cement concrete slabs and re-compacting the same as sub-base/base course in one or more layers. The work shall be performed on such widths and lengths as may be specified, in accordance with the requirements of these Specifications and in conformity with the lines, grades and cross-sections shown on the drawings or as otherwise directed by the Engineer.\n\n# 405.2 Materials\n\n# 405.2.1 Coarse Aggregates\n\nCoarse aggregates for this work shall be broken cement concrete slabs crushed to a size not exceeding 75 mm and as far as possible, conforming to one of the gradings given in table 400-9.\n\n# 405.3 Construction Operations\n\n# 405.3.1 General\n\nCrushed cement concrete sub-base course may be constructed in one or two layers, depending upon the thickness of the concrete slabs dismantled and crushed.

The type of roller to be used shall be approved by the Engineer based on trial run.\n\nExcept on superelevated portions and carriageway with unidirectional cross-fall where the rolling shall proceed from inner edge to the outer, rolling shall begin from the edges gradually progressing towards the center. First the edge/edges shall be compacted with roller running forward and backward. The roller shall then move inward parallel to the center line of the road, in successive passes uniformly overlapping preceding tracks by at least one-half width.\n\nRolling shall be continued and light sprinkling of water shall be done till the surface is well compacted.\n\nThe rolled surface shall be checked transversely with templates and longitudinally with 3 m straight edge. Any irregularities, exceeding 12 mm, shall be corrected by loosening the surface, adding or removing necessary amount of aggregates and re-rolling until the entire surface conforms to the desired camber and grade.\n\n# 405.4 Surface Finish and Quality Control of Work\n\nThe surface finish and control on the quality of materials and works shall be exercised by the Engineer in accordance with Section 900.\n\n# 405.5 Arrangements for Traffic\n\nDuring the period of construction, arrangement for traffic shall be done as per Clause 112.\n\n130\n\nSub-Bases, Bases (Non-Bituminous) and Shoulders\n# Section 400\n\n# 405.6 Measurements for payment\n\nBreaking the existing cement concrete pavement slabs, crushing and recompacting the slab material as sub-base course shall be measured as a single item in terms of the volume of sub-base laid in position in cubic metres.\n\n# 405.7 rate\n\nThe Contract unit rate for crushed cement concrete sub-base course shall be payment in full for carrying out the required operations including full compensation for:\n\n- i) making arrangements for traffic to Clause 112 except for initial treatment to verges/shoulders and construction of diversions;\n- ii) breaking the cement concrete slabs, crushing, sieving and recompacting the slab material as sub-base course;\n- iii) all labour, tools, equipment and incidentals to complete the work to the Specifications;\n- iv) carrying out the work in part widths of road where directed; and\n- v) carrying out the required tests for quality control.\n\n# 406 wet Mix Macadam Sub-Base/Base\n\n# 406.1 scope\n\nThis work shall consist of laying and compacting clean, crushed, graded aggregate and granular material, premixed with water, to a dense mass on a prepared sub-grade/sub-base/base or existing pavement as the case may be in accordance with the requirements of these Specifications.

While adding water, due allowance should be made for evaporation losses. However, at the time of compaction, water in the wet mix should not vary from the optimum value by more than agreed limits. The mixed material should be uniformly wet and no segregation should be permitted.\n\n133\n\nSection 400 Sub-Bases, Bases (Non-Bituminous) and Shoulders\n\n# 406.3.4 Spreading of Mix\n\nImmediately after mixing, the aggregates shall be spread uniformly and evenly upon the prepared sub-grade/sub-base/base in required quantities. In no case shall these be dumped in heaps directly on the area where these are to be laid nor shall their hauling over a partly completed stretch be permitted.\n\nThe mix may be spread by a paver finisher. The paver finisher shall be self-propelled of adequate capacity with following features:\n\n- Loading hoppers and suitable distribution system, so as to provide a smooth uninterrupted material flow for different layer thicknesses from the tipper to the screed.\n- Hydraulically operated telescopic screed for paving width up to 8.5 m and fixed screed beyond this. The screed shall have tamping and vibrating arrangement for initial compaction of the layer.\n- Automatic levelling control system with electronic sensing device to maintain mat thickness and cross slope of mat during laying procedure.\n\nIn exceptional cases where it is not possible for the paver to be utilized, mechanical means like motor grader may be used with the prior approval of the Engineer. The motor grader shall be capable of spreading the material uniformly all over the surface.\n\nThe surface of the aggregate shall be carefully checked with templates and all high or low spots remedied by removing or adding aggregate as may be required.

An appropriate frequency and amplitude may be selected. The speed of the roller shall not exceed 5 km/h.\n\nIn portions having unidirectional cross fall/superelevation, rolling shall commence from the lower edge and progress gradually towards the upper edge. Thereafter, roller should progress parallel to the center line of the road, uniformly over-lapping each preceding track by at least one-third width until the entire surface has been rolled. Alternate trips of the roller shall be terminated in stops at least 1 m away from any preceding stop.\n\nIn portions in camber, rolling should begin at the edge with the roller running forward and backward until the edges have been firmly compacted. The roller shall then progress gradually towards the center parallel to the center line of the road uniformly overlapping each of the preceding track by at least one-third width until the entire surface has been rolled.\n\nAny displacement occurring as a result of reversing of the direction of a roller or from any other cause shall be corrected at once as specified and/or removed and made good.\n\nAlong forms, kerbs, walls or other places not accessible to the roller, the mixture shall be thoroughly compacted with mechanical tampers or a plate compactor. Skin patching of an area without scarifying the surface to permit proper bonding of the added material shall not be permitted.\n\nRolling should not be done when the sub-grade is soft or yielding or when it causes a wave-like motion in the sub-base/base course or sub-grade. If irregularities develop during rolling which exceed 12 mm when tested with a 3 m straight edge, the surface should be loosened and premixed material added or removed as required before rolling again so as to achieve a uniform surface conforming to the desired grade and crossfall. In no case shall the use of unmixed material be permitted to make up the depressions.\n\nRolling shall be continued till the density achieved is at least 98 percent of the maximum dry density for the material as determined by the method outlined in IS:2720 (Part-8).\n\nAfter completion, the surface of any finished layer shall be well-closed, free from movement under compaction equipment or any compaction planes, ridges, cracks and loose material. All loose, segregated or otherwise defective areas shall be made good to the full thickness of the layer and recompacted.\n\n# 406.3.6 setting and drying\n\nAfter final compaction of wet mix macadam course, the road shall be allowed to dry for 24 hours.\n\n135\n\nSection 400\n# Sub-Bases, Bases (Non-Bituminous) and Shoulders\n\n# 406.4 Opening to Traffic\n\nNo vehicular traffic shall be allowed on the finished wet mix macadam surface.

Where modified bitumen is specified, it shall conform to the requirements of IRC:SP:53 and IS:15462; and the following provision of this Specification shall apply.\n\n- Modified bitumen from refinery sources or blended at approved central plant or at site using appropriate industrial process and plant with high shear mill, and testing facilities to achieve stable and homogenous mix shall be used. The use of high shear mixer or any other device capable of producing a homogeneous blend is essential when the modifier is in powder form.\n- Transportation tanks and storage tanks shall be insulated and equipped with effective heating system and circulation/agitating device to maintain the specified temperature, homogeneity and viscosity of the bitumen during transit and storage.\n- Separation, difference in softening point (R&#x26;B), shall not be more than 3\u00baC for any type of specified modified bitumen when tested as per Annex B of IS:15462.\n\nSelection criteria for viscosity grade bitumen, based on highest and lowest daily mean temperatures at a particular site, are given in Table 500-1.\n\nSelection criteria for modified bitumen shall be in accordance with IRC:SP:53.\n\n149\n\nSection 500\n# Bases and Surface Courses (Bituminous)\n\n# Table 500-1: Selection Criteria for Viscosity-graded (Vg) Paving Bitumens Based on Climatic Conditions\n\n| Lowest Daily Mean Air Temperature, \u00b0C | Highest Daily Mean Air Temperature, \u00b0C |                |       |\n| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------- | ----- |\n| Less than 20\u00b0C                        | 20 to 30\u00b0C                             | More than 30\u00b0C |       |\n| More than \u201310\u00baC                       | VG-10                                  | VG-20          | VG-30 |\n| -10\u00baC or lower                        | VG-10                                  | VG-10          | VG-20 |\n\nBoth the highest daily mean air temperature and the lowest daily mean air temperatures mentioned in Tables 500-5 and 500-6 can be obtained for the weather station nearest to the project site from the Indian Meteorological Organization (IMO). This daily mean high temperature on a specific day is the same as daily \u201cnormal\u201d high temperature for that day as usually reported in some newspapers. The highest of the 365 daily mean high air temperatures (which usually occurs on some day in May or June) is used in Tables 500-5 and 500-6. Likewise, the lowest daily mean air temperature (which usually occurs on some day in January) can also be obtained from the IMO. Since these are mean temperatures based on the average of 30-40 years data, these temperatures are significantly lower than the absolute maximum temperatures, which may have occurred in a specific year.\n\n# 501.2.2 Coarse Aggregates\n\nThe coarse aggregates shall consist of crushed rock, crushed gravel or other hard material retained on the 2.36 mm sieve.

The essential features of the paver finisher shall conform to Annex A of IRC:27. As soon as possible after arrival at site, the materials shall be supplied continuously to the paver and laid without delay.\n\nBases and Surface Courses (Bituminous)                                         Section 500\n\nThe rate of delivery of material to the paver shall be regulated to enable the paver to operate continuously. The travel rate of the paver, and its method of operations, shall be adjusted to ensure an even and uniform flow of bituminous material across the screed, free from dragging, tearing and segregation of the material. In areas with restricted space (such as confined space, foot ways, of irregular shape and varying thickness, approaches to expansion joints, etc.) where paver cannot be used, the material shall be spread, raked and levelled with suitable hand tools by trained staff.\n\nThe minimum thickness of material laid in each paver pass shall be in accordance with the minimum values given in the relevant parts of these Specifications. When laying binder course or wearing course approaching an expansion joint of a structure, machine laying shall stop 300 mm short of the joint.

The only traffic permitted to run on bituminous material to be overlaid shall be that engaged in laying and compacting the next course or, where a binder course is to be sealed or surface dressed, that engaged on such surface treatment. Should any bituminous material become contaminated, the Contractor shall make it good to the satisfaction of the Engineer, in compliance with Clause 501.8. Binder course material shall be covered by either the wearing course or surface treatment, whichever is specified in the Contract.\n\n# 501.6 Compaction\n\nBituminous materials shall be laid and compacted in layers, which enable the specified thickness, surface level, regularity requirements and compaction to be achieved. Compaction of bituminous materials shall commence as soon as possible after laying. Compaction shall be substantially completed before the temperature falls below the minimum rolling temperatures stated in the relevant part of these Specifications. Rolling of the longitudinal joints shall be done immediately behind the paving operation. After this, rolling shall commence at the edges and progress towards the center longitudinally except that on super-elevated and unidirectionally cambered portions, it shall progress from the lower to the upper edge parallel to the center line of the pavement. Rolling shall continue until all roller marks have been removed from the surface. All deficiencies in the surface after laying shall be addressed.\n\n\n\nSection 500\n# Bases and Surface Courses (Bituminous)\n\nbe made good by the attendants behind the paver, before initial rolling is commenced. The initial or breakdown rolling shall be done with 8\u201310 tonne static weight smooth-wheel rollers.

The Contractor shall demonstrate the efficiency of the equipment proposed to be used by carrying compaction trials. The procedure for site trials shall be submitted to the Engineer for approval. The finish rolling shall be done with 6 to 8 tonne smooth wheel tandem rollers. Rolling shall continue until the specified compaction is achieved.\n\nWhere compaction is to be determined by density of cores, the requirements to prove the performance of rollers shall apply in order to demonstrate that the specified density can be achieved. In such cases the Contractor shall specify the plant, and the method by which he intends to achieve the specified level of compaction and finish at temperatures above the minimum specified rolling temperature. Laying trials shall then demonstrate the acceptability of the plant and method used.\n\nBituminous materials shall be rolled in a longitudinal direction, with the driven rolls nearest the paver. The roller shall first compact material adjacent to joints and then work from the lower to the upper side of the layer, overlapping on successive passes by at least one-third of the width of the rear roll or, in the case of a pneumatic-tyred roller, at least the nominal width of 300 mm.\n\nIn portions with super-elevated and unidirectional camber, after the edge has been rolled, the roller shall progress from the lower to the upper edge.\n\nRollers should move at a speed of not more than 5 km per hour. The roller shall not be permitted to stand on pavement which has not been fully compacted, and necessary precautions shall be taken to prevent dropping of oil, grease, petrol/ diesel or other foreign matter on the pavement either when the rollers are operating or standing. The wheels of roller machine shall be in good working order, to prevent the mix from adhering to the wheels. Only sufficient moisture to prevent adhesion between the wheels of rollers and the mix should be used. Surplus water shall not be allowed to stand on the partially compacted pavement.\n\n# 501.7 Joints\n\n# 501.7.1\n\nWhere joints are made, the material shall be fully compacted and the joint made flush in one of the following ways:\n\n- a) All joints shall be cut vertical to the full thickness of the previously laid mix. All loosened material shall be discarded and the vertical face coated with a suitable viscosity grade hot bitumen, or cold applied emulsified bitumen. While spreading the material along the joint the material spread shall overlap 25 mm to 50 mm on the previously laid mix beyond the vertical face of the joint.\n\nBases and Surface Courses (Bituminous)                                         Section 500\n\noverlap material should be approximately a quarter more than the final compacted thickness. The overlapped mix shall be dragged back to the hot lane so that the roller can press the small excess into the hot side of the joint to obtain a high joint density.\n\nb) By using two or more pavers operating in echelon, where this is practicable and in sufficient proximity for adjacent widths to be fully compacted by continuous rolling.\n\n# 501.7.2\n\nAll longitudinal joints shall be offset at least 300 mm from parallel joints in the layer beneath or as directed, and in a layout approved by the Engineer. Joints in the wearing course shall coincide with either the lane edge or the lane marking, whichever is appropriate. Longitudinal joints shall not be situated in wheel track zones.\n\n# 501.7.3\n\nFor transverse joints method a) above shall apply.

In the case of a cement concrete base, the surface shall be thoroughly power brushed clean and free of dust and other deleterious matter. Under no circumstances shall mastic asphalt be spread on a base containing a binder which might soften under high application temperatures. If such material exists, the same shall be cut out and repaired before the mastic asphalt is laid.\n\n# 516.4.3 Tack Coat\n\nA tack coat in accordance with Clause 503 shall be applied on the base or as directed by the Engineer.\n\n# 516.4.4 Preparation of Mastic Asphalt\n\nPreparation of mastic asphalt consists of two stages. The first stage shall be mixing of filler and fine aggregates and then heating the mixture to a temperature of 170\u00b0C to 210\u00b0C. Required quantity of bitumen shall be heated to 170\u00b0C to 180\u00b0C and added to the heated aggregates. They shall be mixed and cooked in an approved type of mechanically agitated mastic cooker for some time till the materials are thoroughly mixed. Initially the filler alone is to be heated in the cooker for an hour and then half the quantity of binder is added. After heating and mixing for some time, the fine aggregates and the balance of binder are to be added and further cooked for about one hour. The second stage is incorporation of coarse aggregates and cooking the mixtures for a total period of 3 hours. During cooking and mixing care shall be taken to ensure that the contents in the cooker are at no time heated to a temperature exceeding 210\u00b0C.\n\nWhere the material is not required for immediate use it shall be cast into blocks consisting of filler, fine aggregates and binder, but without the addition of coarse aggregate, weighing about 25 kg each. Before use, these blocks shall be reheated to a temperature of not less than 175\u00b0C and not more than 210\u00b0C, thoroughly incorporated with the requisite quantity of coarse aggregates and mixed continuously. Mixing shall be continued until laying operations are completed so as to maintain the coarse aggregates in suspension. At no stage during the process of mixing shall the temperature exceed 210\u00b0C.\n\nThe mastic asphalt blocks (without coarse aggregate) shall show on analysis a composition within the limits as given in Table 500-42.\n\nThe mix shall be transported to the laying site in a towed mixer transporter having arrangements for stirring and keeping the mix hot during transportation.\n\n228\n\nBases and Surface Courses (Bituminous) Section 500\n\n# 516.4.5 Spreading\n\nThe mastic asphalt shall be laid, normally in one coat, at a temperature between 175\u00b0C and 210\u00b0C and spread uniformly by hand using wooden floats or by machine on the prepared surface. The thickness of the mastic asphalt and the percentage of added coarse aggregate shall be in accordance with Table 500-40 or as specified by the Engineer. Where necessary, battens of the requisite dimensions should be employed. Any blow holes that appear in the surface shall be punctured while the material is hot, and the surface made good by further floating.\n\n# Laying Surface Over Existing Bridge Deck\n\nBefore laying bitumen over existing bridge deck, the existing cross fall/camber, expansion joint members and water drainage spouts shall be carefully examined for their proper functioning in the bridge deck structure and any deficiency found shall be removed. Loose elements in the expansion joint shall be firmly secured. The existing wearing coat shall be removed, as per Clause 2809. The cracks in the concrete surface, if any, shall be repaired and filled up properly or replaced by new concrete of specified grade before laying the bitumen mastic over bridge deck.\n\n# Laying Over New Bridge Deck\n\nNew concrete bridge deck which is not in camber/cross fall shall first be provided with required camber and cross fall by suitable concrete or bituminous treatment.\n\n# Treatment Where Mastic Asphalt is Laid Over a Concrete Surface\n\nIn case of laying over concrete surface, following measures shall be taken:\n\n1. For proper bond with new concrete deck, surface shall be roughened by means of stiff broom or wire brush and it shall be free from ridges and troughs.\n2. A thin bituminous tack coat (with bitumen of grade VG 30) shall be applied on the concrete deck before pouring mastic. The deck shall be dry. The quantity of bitumen for tack coat shall be as per Table 500-6.\n3. After applying tack coat, chicken-mesh reinforcement of 1.5 mm dia steel wire with hexagonal or rectangular openings of 20-25 mm shall be placed and held properly in position on the concrete surface before pouring mastic.\n\n# 516.4.6 Joints\n\nAll construction joints shall be properly and truly made. These joints shall be made by warming existing mastic asphalt by the application of an excess quantity of the hot mastic asphalt mix which afterwards shall be trimmed to leave it flush with the surfaces on either side.\n\n229\n\nSection 500\n# Bases and Surface Courses (Bituminous)\n\n# 516.4.7 Surface Finish\n\nThe mastic asphalt surface can have poor skid resistance after floating. In order to provide resistance to skidding, the mastic asphalt after spreading, while still hot and in a plastic condition, shall be covered with a layer of stone aggregate. This aggregate shall be 13.2 mm size (passing the 19.0 mm sieve and retained on the 6.7 mm sieve) or 9.5 mm size (passing the 13.2 mm sieve and retained on the 6.7 mm sieve) subject to the approval of the Engineer. Hard stone chips, complying with the quality requirements of Table 500-16, shall be precoated with bitumen at the rate of 2 \u00b1 0.4 percent of VG 30 grade. The addition of 2 percent of filler complying with Table 500-9 may be required to enable this quantity of binder to be held without draining. The chips shall then be applied at the rate of 0.005 cu.m per 10 sq.m and rolled or otherwise pressed into the surface of the mastic layer when the temperature of the mastic asphalt is not less than 100\u00b0C.\n\n# 516.5 Opening of Traffic\n\nTraffic may be allowed after completion of the work when the mastic asphalt temperature of the completed layer has cooled to the daytime maximum ambient temperature.\n\n# 516.6 Surface Finish and Quality Control of Work\n\nThe surface finish of the completed construction shall conform to the requirements of Clause 902. For control of the quality of materials and the works carried out, the relevant provisions of Section 900 shall apply. The surface of the mastic asphalt, tested with a straight edge 3 m long, placed parallel to the centre line of the carriageway, shall have no depression greater than 7 mm. The same shall also apply to the transverse profile when tested with a camber template.\n\n# 516.7 Arrangements for Traffic\n\nDuring the period of construction, arrangements for traffic shall be made in accordance with the provisions of Clause 112.\n\n# 516.8 Measurement for Payment\n\nMastic asphalt shall be measured as finished work in square metres at a specified thickness, or by weight in tonnes as stated in the Contract.\n\n# 516.9 Rate\n\nThe contract unit rate for mastic asphalt shall be payment in full for carrying out the required operations including full compensation for all components listed under Clause 501.8.2.2.\n\n230\n\nBases and Surface Courses (Bituminous)                                         Section 500\n\n# 517              crack preVention courses\n\n# 517.1            scope\n\nThe work shall consist of providing one or two coats of an elastomeric rubber membrane known as Stress Absorbing Membrane (SAM) over a cracked surface, followed by a covering of aggregate chips, and a Stress Absorbing Membrane Interlayer (SAMI), which is a material similar to SAM or which consists of a bitumen impregnated geotextile, as specified in the Contract.\n\n# 517.2            Materials\n\n# 517.2.1          Binder\n\nBinder shall be a modified binder complying with the requirements of IS:15462 and IRC:SP:53, according to the requirements of the Contract, except that viscosity grade VG 10 complying with the requirements of IS:73 shall be used in the case of a bitumen impregnated geotextile.\n\n# 517.2.2          aggregate\n\nThe requirements of Clause 510.2.2 apply except that the Polished Stone Value requirement does not apply in the case of SAMI.

The method adopted shall be that described in Appendix F and H of Asphalt Institute\u2019s Manual, MS-14.\n\n# 518.2.2.3 Job Mix formula\n\nThe Contractor shall submit to the Engineer for approval at least one month before the start of the work, the job mix formula proposed for use in the works together with the following details:\n\n- i) Source and location of all materials;\n- ii) Proportions of all materials expressed as follows where each is applicable:\n- a) Binder, as percentage by weight of total mix;\n- b) Coarse aggregate/fine aggregate as percentage by weight of total aggregate;\n- iii) A single definite percentage passing each sieve for the mixed aggregate;\n- iv) The results of tests enumerated in Table 500-46 as obtained by the Contractor;\n\n236\n\nBases and Surface Courses (Bituminous) Section 500\n\nv) Test results of the physical characteristics of the aggregates to be used;\n\nvi) Spraying temperature of binder if appropriate.\n\nWhile working out the job mix formula, the Contractor shall ensure that it is based on a correct and truly representative sample of the materials that will actually be used in the work and that the mix and its different ingredients satisfy the physical and strength requirements of these Specifications.\n\nApproval of the job mix formula shall be based on independent testing by the Engineer for which samples selected jointly with the Engineer of all ingredients of the mix shall be furnished by the Contractor as required by the former.\n\nThe approved job mix formula shall remain effective unless and until modified by the Engineer. Should a change in the source of materials be proposed, a new job mix formula shall be established by the Contractor and approved by the Engineer before actually using the materials.\n\n# 518.2.2.4 permissible Variation from the Job Mix formula\n\nIt shall be the responsibility of the Contractor to produce a uniform mix conforming to the approved job mix formula, subject to the permissible variations of the individual percentages of the various ingredients in the actual mix from the job mix formula to be used, within the limits as specified in Tables 500-13 and 500-18. These variations are intended to apply to individual specimens taken for quality control tests in accordance with Section 900.\n\n# 518.2.3 construction operations\n\n# 518.2.3.1 weather and seasonal limitations\n\nConstruction with cold mix must not be undertaken when ambient temperatures below 10\u00b0C are expected, during rain, in standing water, or generally when poor weather is predicted. Bitumen emulsions and cutbacks depend on the evaporation of water and/or solvent for the development of their curing and adhesion characteristics. Cold weather, rain and high humidity slow down the rate of curing. Extra manipulation may be required to remove volatiles in cool and humid conditions. Wind increases the rate of evaporation.\n\n# 518.2.3.2 preparation of the Base\n\nThe base on which cold mix is to be laid shall be prepared, shaped and levelled to the required profile in accordance with Clauses 501 and 902 as appropriate, and a prime coat, where specified, shall be applied in accordance with Clause 502 or as directed by the Engineer.\n\n237\n\nSection 500\n# Bases and Surface Courses (Bituminous)\n\n# 518.2.3.3 tack coat\n\nA tack coat in accordance with Clause 503 shall be applied over the base on which the cold mix is to be laid where specified in the Contract.\n\n# 518.2.3.4 preparation and transportation of the Mix\n\nMixing can be carried out using one of the following types of mixer, which is provided with equipment for spraying the binder at a controlled rate and, if necessary, for heating the binder to a temperature at which it can be applied uniformly to the aggregate:\n\n- a) rotary drum type concrete mixer for small jobs or asphalt cold mix plant;\n- b) batch or continuous type mixer without dryer\n\nA sufficient number of haul trucks with smooth, clean beds should be available to ensure continuous operation of the mixing plant. The type of truck used for transporting the mixture from the mixer to the road site shall suit to the Contractor\u2019s proposed laying procedure methodology.\n\n# 518.2.3.5 spreading\n\nDesigned cold mix shall be placed by a paver or grader as specified in the Contract. The mix shall not be placed on any wet surface or when weather conditions will otherwise prevent its proper handling or finishing.\n\nIf spreading by motor grader, the grader shall have a blade that is straight and sharp and long enough to ensure finishing to close, straight, transverse tolerances and all joints and linkages must be in good condition. The grader must be heavy enough to hold the blade firmly and uniformly on the surface while spreading the mix.\n\nIf climatic conditions and aggregate grading do not permit evaporation of moisture or volatiles without aeration by manipulation, a grader shall be used to place designed cold mix. Other methods of spreading may be used as approved by the Engineer.\n\n# 518.2.3.6 compaction\n\nInitial compaction of the laid material shall preferably be carried out using a pneumatic-tyred roller of a weight appropriate to the layer thickness to be compacted with single layer thickness being 25-100 mm and all compaction being in accordance with Clauses 501.6 and 501.7. Smooth tyres shall be used. Final rolling and smoothening of the surface should be completed using steel wheel rollers. The Contractor shall demonstrate at laying trials that his proposed laying and compaction methods can achieve a satisfactory result.\n\n238\n\nBases and Surface Courses (Bituminous)                                         Section 500\n\n# 518.2.4 Opening to Traffic\n\nTraffic shall not be allowed to run on new work until all the water or volatiles in the mix have evaporated, as determined by the Engineer. The rate of evaporation will be influenced by the temperature, humidity and wind conditions.\n\n# 518.2.5 Surface Finish and Quality Control of Work\n\nThe surface finish of construction shall conform to the requirements of Clause 902. For control of the quality of materials and the works carried out, the relevant provisions of Section 900 shall apply.\n\n# 518.2.6 Arrangements for Traffic\n\nDuring the period of construction, arrangements for traffic shall be made in accordance with the provisions of Clause 112.\n\n# 518.2.7 Measurement for Payment\n\nDesigned Cold Mix shall be measured as finished work, for the area covered, in cubic metres, by weight in metric tonnes, or by square metres at a specified thickness as specified in the Contract.\n\n# 518.2.8 Rate\n\nThe contract unit rate for Designed Cold Mix shall be payment in full for carrying out the required operations including full compensation for all components listed in Clause 501.8.8.2. The rate shall cover the provision of the specified grade of cutback in the mix at 5 percent of the weight of the total mix or emulsion at 8 percent of the weight of the total mix. However, any variation in quantity of binder will be assessed on the basis of the amount agreed by the Engineer and the payment adjusted, plus or minus, as per the rate for cutback or emulsion quoted in the Bill of Quantities.\n\n# 518.3 Recipe Cold Mix\n\n# 518.3.1 Scope\n\nThe work consists of construction of Recipe Cold Mixes composed of aggregate and emulsion binder which are laid immediately after mixing and while the emulsion is still substantially in an unbroken state. These mixes are considered suitable for emergency and repair work and temporary road surface improvement.\n\n239\n\nSection 500\n# Bases and Surface Courses (Bituminous)\n\n# 518.3.2 Materials\n\n# 518.3.2.1 Binder\n\nEmulsions of sufficient stability for mixing with the particular graded aggregate should be used.

The rate shall cover the provision of the specified grade of emulsion at the lower quantity in the range for each type of mix indicated in Table 500-47. However, any variation of quantity in emulsion will be assessed on the basis of the amount agreed by the Engineer and the payment adjusted plus or minus, as per the rate for emulsion quoted in the Bill of Quantities.\n\n# 519 Recycling of Bituminous Pavement\n\n# 519.1 Scope\n\nThis work covers the recycling of existing bituminous pavement materials to upgrade an existing bituminous pavement which has served its initially intended purpose. The work shall be performed on such widths and lengths as shall be directed by the Engineer and may consist of pavement removal, stockpiling of materials from the old pavement, addition of new bitumen and untreated aggregates in the requisite proportions, mixing, spreading and compaction of the blended materials. These specifications cover the hot process.\n\n# 519.2 Reclaimed Bituminous Materials for Central Plant Recycling\n\n# 519.2.1\n\nThe reclaimed bituminous material shall be used in the production of bituminous macadam and dense bituminous macadam subject to the Clauses 519.2.3 to 519.2.8, and subject to satisfactory completion of full investigations in respect of all related materials entirely at the Contractor\u2019s cost and subject to the approval of the Engineer.\n\nBases and Surface Courses (Bituminous) Section 500\n\nestimation purposes, an amount not greater than 60 per cent of reclaimed bituminous material shall be assumed.\n\n# 519.2.2 Materials for recycled pavement\n\nThe recycled materials shall be a blend of reclaimed and new materials proportioned to achieve a paving mixture with the specified engineering properties. The reclaimed materials shall be tested and evaluated to find the optimum blend meeting the mixture requirements. Such testing and evaluation shall be carried out on representative sample, either cores sampled from the carriageway or samples taken from stockpiles in accordance with current practice. The sampling frequency should be sufficient to determine how consistent the reclaimed material is and to provide representative samples for composition analysis and measurement of properties of recovered binder. As an absolute minimum, one sample to represent 500 m two lane carriageway shall be taken.\n\n# 519.2.3 Bitumen extraction\n\nThe procedure described in ASTM D-2172 shall be used to quantitatively separate aggregates and bitumen from any representative sample of reclaimed bituminous pavement.\n\n# 519.2.4 aggregate evaluation\n\nMechanical sieve analysis (IS:2386, Part I, wet sieving method) shall be performed on the aggregate portion of the reclaimed bituminous pavement sample to determine the grading. It is essential that the reclaimed materials to be recycled are consistent, as variable materials will cause problems with the control of quality and impede the efficiency of the recycling operation. Suitable sources of consistent material either in existing pavements, from stockpiled of known origin or from another suitable source shall be identified before a decision can be made on the optimum percentage of reclaimed material. After selecting the proportion of reclaimed materials to be recycled, the grading of the mixture may need adjustment, to meet Specification requirements, by the addition of selected aggregate sizes.\n\n# 519.2.5 evaluation of Bitumen\n\nWhen the amount of reclaimed bituminous materials to be used in the mixture exceeds 10 percent, the penetration value of the recovered binder from the reclaimed bituminous material, before mixing, shall exceed 15 pen, after recovery of binder in accordance with the requirements of BS:2000:Part 397, when tested in accordance with IS:1203.\n\nProvided the\n\nSection 500\n# Bases and Surface Courses (Bituminous)\n\nabove requirement is met, hardening of the old binder, during the original mixing process or through ageing, can be compensated for by adding softer bitumen, to obtain the appropriate final grade of binder.\n\nThe determination of the type and amount of binder required to be added in the final mix is essentially a trial and error procedure.\n\nAfter mixing with recycled materials, the binder recovered from the mixture shall have a recovered penetration value not less than the value specified in Table 500-48.\n\n| Specified Grade of Binder   | Minimum recovered penetration Value of Binder after Mixing |\n| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Viscosity grade 40 (45 pen) | 27                                                         |\n| Viscosity grade 30 (65 pen) | 39                                                         |\n| Viscosity grade 10 (90 pen) | 54                                                         |\n\n# 519.2.6 Rejuvenators\n\nThe use of rejuvenators, and a test to measure their effectiveness, is given in Clause 519.6.3.\n\n# 519.2.7 Untreated Aggregates\n\nIf necessary, fresh untreated aggregates shall be added to the reclaimed bituminous pavement to produce a mix with the desired grading. The aggregate shall be checked for quality requirements in accordance with Table 500-7 or Table 500-10 as appropriate. Reclaimed aggregate, if any, or any aggregate normally used for the desired bituminous mix, or both, may be used for this purpose.\n\n# 519.2.8 Combined Aggregate Grading\n\nThe blend reclaimed and new aggregate shall meet the grading criteria specified in the relevant parts of Clauses 505 or 506, as appropriate and as approved by the Engineer. The blend of aggregates shall be checked for resistance to stripping as specified in Tables 500-7 or 500-10 as appropriate.\n\n244\n\nBases and Surface Courses (Bituminous) Section 500\n\n# 519.3 Mixture design\n\nThe combined aggregate grading and binder content shall comply with the relevant tables in Clauses 504 or 505 as appropriate. The mix design shall also comply with the requirements of Table 500-10. There may be a variation on three to four sieves with respect to percent passing, the permissible variation shall not exceed 3 to 4 percent per sieve.\n\n# 519.4 reclaiming old pavement Materials\n\nThe removal of pavement materials to the required depth shall be accomplished either at ambient temperature (cold process) or at an elevated temperature (hot process), as approved by the Engineer.\n\n# 519.4.1 cold removal process\n\nIn the cold process, the ripping and crushing operations shall be carried out using scarifiers, grid rollers, or rippers or by any other means as directed by the Engineer. The removed materials shall be loaded and hauled for crushing to the required size as directed by the Engineer. Alternatively, cold milling or planning machines can be used to reclaim bituminous pavement to controlled depths. Thereafter the bituminous layers are removed, any remaining aggregate materials that are to be incorporated in the recycled hot mix shall be scarified and removed. When the pavement material removal is completed, any drainage deficiencies shall be corrected. After that, the base/sub-base, as the case may be, shall be cut, graded and compacted to the required profile and density.\n\n# 519.4.2 Hot removal process\n\nIn the hot process, the road surface shall be heated, by infra-red/ hot-air heating system, before scarification. A self propelled plant fitted with suitable arrangement for heating the existing bituminous surface shall be used. A milling drum shall follow the planer for removing the heated soft bituminous layer. The depth, width and speed of travel shall be adjusted to suit specific requirements as directed by the Engineer. During the heating process, the surface temperature of the road shall not exceed 200\u00b0C for more than 5 minutes.\n\n# 519.4.3 stockpiling\n\nIn the cold process, the reclaimed bituminous pavement material shall be stockpiled with height of stockpiles not exceeding 3 m. The reclaimed untreated aggregate base/sub-base material shall be stockpiled in the same manner as new aggregate. The number and location of stockpiles shall be carefully planned for efficient operation of the hot-mix plant.\n\n245\n\nSection 500\n# Bases and Surface Courses (Bituminous)\n\n# 519.5 Mixing and laying\n\nthe requirements of Clauses 504.3 or 505.4, as appropriate shall apply.\n\n# 519.6 in situ recycling \u2013 the remix and repave processes\n\n# 519.6.1 scope\n\nIn the process of repaving, the existing surface is preheated and scarified but the scarified material is not removed. A layer of fresh bituminous mix material prepared in the integrated mixing unit of the plant is then spread evenly on the scarified surface to give a uniform profile. The spread material should be compacted as soon as possible after laying. In the process, the total thickness of the pavement is increased by up to 50 mm.\n\nIn the remix process, the scarified material should be taken from the mixing unit of the plant where it is recycled with fresh binder, aggregate and recycling agent. Then the recycled mixture is spread on the preheated surface and tamped and compacted to the required profile.\n\n# 519.6.2 Heating and scarifying\n\nSurfaces to be treated shall be heated by plant with surfaces insulated and fully enclosed. The heated width of surfacing shall exceed the scarified width by at least 75 mm on each side, except against the edge of the carriageway or kerb face. When new surfacing material is spilled onto the road surface it shall be removed before the existing surface is heated and scarified. Areas of unscarified material shall not exceed 50 mm x 50 mm.\n\nThe depth of scarification shall be such that the bottom of the scarified layer is parallel to and below the finished road surface level by the thickness of wearing course material specified. A tolerance of \u00b16 mm is permissible.\n\nWhere street furniture and other obstructions occur, these shall be suitably protected or removed and the void covered. Surface dressing and large areas of road markings shall be removed by milling, planning scarifying or by similar approved processes.\n\nThe heated surface shall be evenly scarified to comply with the requirements of this Clause. When street furniture is left in place or raised, the adjacent area shall be scarified by other means, with the material either left in place or removed, prior to passage of the machine. If furniture needs to be repositioned on completion of work, the new wearing course material shall be used to make good the road surface for a maximum width of 200 mm around the obstruction.\n\n246\n\nBases and Surface Courses (Bituminous)                                         Section 500\n\nDuring the reheating process, the surface temperature of the road shall not exceed 200\u00b0C for more than 5 minutes.\n\n# 519.6.3 Rejuvenator\n\nFor Remix, when required, rejuvenator shall be uniformly sprayed across the full width of the processed material. The machine shall incorporate a metre for continuous verification of quantities which shall be within \u00b15% of the specified rate. The volume of rejuvenator shall vary in relation to the operating speed of the machine, which shall be related to the volume of material mixed or scarified.\n\nThe rejuvenator shall be a non-emulsified aromatic extract. Its properties shall be verified using the Rolling Thin Film Oven Test.\n\nRejuvenation of the existing pavement may also be performed by adding new hot-mix bituminous material containing a soft binder for restoring the binder in the existing pavement to the required viscosity. Use of rejuvenating oil may be resorted to in case the target values of viscosity, penetration and softening are not met.\n\n# 519.6.4 Mixing\n\nWhen required, new hot-mix material shall be mixed with the heated and scarified road pavement material in a pugmill within the Remix machine, observing the mixing temperatures specified in Table 500-2.\n\nAfter mixing, the recycled bituminous materials shall be automatically led to a finishing unit, which spreads and levels the mixture to the specified thickness and cross-section. The new bituminous concrete wearing course shall comply with Clause 507.\n\n# 519.6.5 Additional Material (General)\n\nThe proportion of new hot-mix bituminous material, and the proportion of existing bituminous pavement material shall be as directed by the Engineer, together with the amount the road surface level is to be raised (if any).\n\nThe type and quantity of the new hot-mix material shall be determined by using the Marshall Mix Design procedure specified in the Asphalt Institute Manual MS-2, before work commences. Remix designs shall incorporate the stated proportion of material sampled from the existing road surface.\n\nWhen additional coarse or fine aggregate or filler are required to be added, they shall comply with the requirements of Clause 508.2. The amount of additional coarse or fine aggregate or filler to be added to the existing bituminous pavement material shall be notified to the Engineer.\n\n247\n\nSection 500\n# Bases and Surface Courses (Bituminous)\n\n# 519.6.6 additional aggregate (remix process)\n\nThe coarse aggregate, fine aggregate and filler added to the Remixed material shall comply with the requirements of Clause 507.2.\n\n# 519.6.7 new surfacing (repave and remix/repave processes)\n\nNew surfacing material shall be bituminous concrete wearing course complying with Clause 508, or other wearing course material approved by the Engineer. The new surfacing material shall be laid on, and compacted with, the reprofiled surfacing, which shall be at a temperature within the range of 100\u00baC to 150\u00baC.\n\n# 519.6.8 Binder\n\nThe binder shall be recovered from samples taken from each layer of material laid. The method of recovery shall be in accordance with BS:2000: Part 397 or an equivalent test. The penetration of the binder shall be in the range 35-70 pen.\n\n# 519.6.9 Mixture design\n\nThe surfacing material shall be sampled from the paver hopper or augers. Care shall be taken that only the material forming the new surface layer is sampled. The sample shall be reduced at site by rifling or quartering to approximately 5 kg and placed loose in an air-tight container.\n\nThe sample shall only be reheated once whilst within the container. As soon as the sample reaches the required temperature, the reheated material shall be remixed and three Marshall test specimens prepared in accordance with the procedures specified in MS-2.\n\nThe bulk density of each specimen shall be measured before Marshall Stability testing. The mean stability and flow of the three specimen measured in accordance with the procedures specified in MS-2, shall comply with the requirements of Table 500-11.\n\nThe three Marshall specimens shall be combined and the maximum theoretical specific gravity (G\u2098\u2098) of the mix shall be determined in accordance with ASTM D 2041. This maximum theoretical specific gravity (G\u2098\u2098) corresponds to 0% air voids in the mix. The percent air voids (P\u2090) in the specimen of the compacted mixture given by P\u2090=(G\u2098\u2098\u2013Gmbx100)/G\u2098\u2098 shall meet the requirements of air voids laid down in Table 500-10, where Gmb is the actual bulk specific gravity of a Marshall specimen determined in the Laboratory.\n\n248\n\nBases and Surface Courses (Bituminous)                                         Section 500\n\n# 519.7 Opening to Traffic\n\nFor recycled material forming the base or binder course layer, Clauses 504.5 or 505.5 shall apply as appropriate.

The water content shall be adjusted to the optimum as per Clause 601.3.2 for facilitating compaction by rolling. The strength and density requirements of concrete shall be determined in accordance with Clauses 601.7 and 601.8 by making trial mixes. Care should be taken to prevent one size of aggregate falling into the other size of the hopper of the feeding bin while loading the individual size of aggregates into the bins.\n\n# 601.3.2 Moisture content\n\nThe optimum water content shall be determined and demonstrated by rolling during trial length construction and the optimum moisture content and degree of compaction shall be got approved from Engineer. While laying in the main work, the lean concrete shall have a moisture content between the optimum and optimum +2 percent, keeping in view the effectiveness of compaction achieved and to compensate for evaporation losses.\n\n# 601.3.3 Cement content\n\nThe cement content in the dry lean concrete shall be such that the strength specified in Clause 601.3.4 is achieved. The minimum cement content shall be 150 kg/cu.m of concrete. In case flyash is blended at site as part replacement of cement, the quantity of flyash shall not be more than 20 percent by weight of cementitious material and the content of OPC shall not be less than 120 kg/cu.m. If this minimum is not sufficient to produce dry lean concrete of the specified strength, it shall be increased as necessary by the Contractor at his own cost.\n\n# 601.3.4 Concrete strength\n\nThe average compressive strength of each consecutive group of 5 cubes made in accordance with Clause 903.5.1.1 shall not be less than 10 MPa at 7 days. In addition, the minimum compressive strength of any individual cube shall not be less than 7.5 MPa at 7 days.

The pace and programme of the Dry Lean Concrete sub-base construction shall be matching suitably with the programme of construction of the cement concrete pavement over it. The Dry Lean Concrete sub-base shall be overlaid with concrete pavement only after 7 days of sub-base construction.\n\n# 601.6.2 Batching and Mixing\n\nThe batching plant shall be capable of proportioning the materials by weight, each type of material being weighed separately in accordance with Clauses 602.9.2, 602.9.3.1 and 602.9.3.2. The design features of Batching Plant should be such that the plant can be shifted quickly.\n\n# 601.6.3 transporting\n\nPlant mix lean concrete shall be discharged immediately from the mixer, transported directly to the point where it is to be laid and protected from the weather by covering the tipping trucks with tarpaulin during transit. The concrete shall be transported by tipping trucks, sufficient in number to ensure a continuous supply of material to feed the laying equipment to work at a uniform speed and in an uninterrupted manner. The lead of the batching plant to paving site shall be such that the travel time available from mixing to paving as specified in Clause 601.6.5.2 will be adhered to. Tipping truck shall not have old concrete sticking to it. Each tipping truck shall be washed with water jet before next loading as and when required after inspection.\n\n# 601.6.4 placing\n\nLean concrete shall be placed by a paver with electronic sensor on the drainage layer or as specified in the Contract. The equipment shall be capable of laying the material in one layer.\n\n258\n\nConcrete Pavement\n# Section 600\n\nin an even manner without segregation, so that after compaction the total thickness is as specified. The paving machine shall have high amplitude tamping bars to give good initial compaction to the sub-base. One day before placing of the dry lean cement concrete sub-base, the surface of the granular sub-base/drainage layer shall be given a fine spray of water and rolled with a smooth wheeled roller.\n\nPreferably the lean concrete shall be placed and compacted across the full width of the two lane carriageway, by constructing it in one go. In roads with carriageway more than 2 lanes a longitudinal joint shall be provided. Transverse butt type joint shall be provided at the end of the construction in a day. Transverse joints in the concrete pavement shall not be coterminous with the transverse construction joint of the Dry Lean Concrete.\n\nThe Dry Lean Concrete shall be laid in such a way that it is at least 750 mm wider on each side than the proposed width including paved shoulders of the concrete pavement. The actual widening shall be decided based on the specifications of the paver, such that the crawler moves on the Dry Lean Concrete, and the cost of extra width shall be borne by the Contractor.\n\n# 601.6.5 compaction\n\n# 601.6.5.1\n\nThe compaction shall be carried out immediately after the material is laid and levelled. In order to ensure thorough compaction, rolling shall be continued on the full width till there is no further visible movement under the roller and the surface is well closed. The minimum dry density obtained shall not be less than 98 percent of that achieved during the trial length construction in accordance with Clause 601.7. The densities achieved at the edges i.e. 0.5 m from the edge shall not be less than 96 percent of that achieved during the trial construction.\n\n# 601.6.5.2\n\nThe spreading, compacting and finishing of the lean concrete shall be carried out as rapidly as possible and the operation shall be so arranged as to ensure that the time between the mixing of the first batch of concrete in any transverse section of the layer and the final finishing of the same shall not exceed 90 minutes when the temperature of concrete is between 25\u00baC and 30\u00baC, and 120 minutes if less than 25\u00baC. This period may be reviewed by the Engineer in the light of the results of the trial run but in no case shall it exceed 120 minutes. Work shall not proceed when the temperature of the concrete exceeds 30\u00baC. If necessary, chilled water or addition of ice may be resorted to for bringing down the temperature. It is desirable to stop concreting when the ambient temperature is above 35\u00b0C. After compaction has been completed, roller shall not stand on the compacted surface for the duration of the curing period except during commencement of next day\u2019s work near the location where work was terminated the previous day.\n\n# 601.6.5.3\n\nDouble drum smooth-wheeled vibratory rollers of minimum 80 to 100 kN\n\n259\n\n\n# Section 600\n\n# Concrete Pavement\n\nStatic weight are suitable for rolling dry lean concrete. In case any other roller is proposed, the same shall be got approved from the Engineer, after demonstrating its performance. The number of passes required to obtain maximum compaction depends on the thickness of the dry lean concrete, the compactibility of the mix and the weight and type of the roller and the same as well as the total requirement of rollers for the jobs shall be determined during trial run by measuring in-situ density and the scale of the work to be undertaken.\n\nExcept on super elevated portions where rolling shall proceed from the inner edge to the outer, rolling shall begin from the edges gradually progressing towards the centre. First, the edge/edges shall be compacted with a roller running forward and backward. The roller shall then move inward parallel to the centerline of the road, in successive passes uniformly lapping preceding tracks by at least one half width.\n\n# 601.6.5.4\n\nA preliminary pass without vibration to bed the Dry Lean Concrete down shall be given followed by the required number of passes to achieve the desired density and, a final pass without vibration to remove roller with vibration marks and to smoothen the surface.\n\nSpecial care and attention shall be exercised during compaction near joints, kerbs, channels, side forms and around gullies and manholes. In case adequate compaction is not achieved by the roller at these locations, use of plate vibrators shall be made, if so directed by the Engineer.\n\n# 601.6.5.5\n\nThe final lean concrete surface on completion of compaction shall be well closed, free from movement under roller and free from ridges, low spots, cracks, loose material, pot holes, ruts or other defects. The final surface shall be inspected immediately on completion and all loose, segregated or defective areas shall be corrected by using fresh lean concrete material, laid and compacted. For repairing honeycombed/hungry surface, concrete with aggregates of size 10 mm and below shall be spread and compacted as per Specifications. It is necessary to check the level of the rolled surface for compliance. Any level/thickness deficiency shall be corrected after applying concrete with aggregates of size 10 mm and below after roughening the surface. Surface regularity also shall be checked with 3 m straight edge. Strength tests shall be carried out, and if deficiency in strength is noticed, at least three (evenly spread) cores of minimum 100 mm dia per km shall be cut to check deficiency in strength. The holes resulting from cores shall be restored by filling with concrete of the specified strength and compacted by adequate rodding.\n\n# 601.6.5.6\n\nSegregation of concrete in the tipping trucks shall be controlled by moving the dumper back and forth while discharging the mix into the same or by any appropriate means. Paving operation shall be such that the mix does not segregate.\n\n# 601.6.6 Joints\n\nConstruction and longitudinal joints shall be provided as per the drawings.\n\n\n\nConcrete Pavement                                                              Section 600\n\nTransverse butt type joint shall be provided at the end of the construction in a day. Longitudinal construction joint shall be provided only when full width paving is not possible. Transverse joints in Dry Lean concrete shall be staggered from the construction butt type joint in Concrete pavement by 800-1000 mm.\n\nLongitudinal joint in Dry Lean Concrete shall be staggered by 300-400 mm from the longitudinal joint of concrete pavement.\n\nAt longitudinal or transverse construction joints, unless vertical forms are used, the edge of compacted material shall be cut back to a vertical plane where the correct thickness of the properly compacted material has been obtained.\n\n# 601.6.7         curing\n\nAs soon as the lean concrete surface is compacted, curing shall commence. One of the following methods shall be adopted:\n\n- a) Curing may be done by covering the surface by gunny bags/hessian, which shall be kept wet continuously for 7 days by sprinkling water.\n- b) The curing shall be done by spraying with approved resin based aluminized reflective curing compound conforming to ASTM-C 309-81 in accordance with Clause 602.9.12. As soon as the curing compound has lost its tackiness, the surface shall be covered with wet hessian for three days. The rate of application shall be as recommended by the supplier.\n- c) Wax-based white pigmented curing compound with water retention index of not less than 90 percent shall be used to cure the dry lean concrete. The curing compound shall conform to BS:7542. The compound shall be applied uniformly with a mechanical sprayer and with a hood to protect the spray from the wind. The curing compound shall be applied over the entire exposed surface of the Dry Lean Concrete, including sides and edges, at the rate of 0.2 litres/sq.m, or as recommended by the supplier. The first application, referred to as curing application shall be applied immediately after the final rolling of Dry Lean Concrete is completed. As soon as the curing compound loses tackiness, the surface shall be covered with wet hessian for three days. The second application of curing compound also referred to as the debonding application, shall be applied 24 to 48 hours prior to the placement of the concrete pavement. Any damaged Dry Lean Concrete shall be corrected prior to the second application. Normally, the manufacturer\u2019s instructions shall be followed for its application.\n\n261\n\n\n# Section 600\n\n# Concrete Pavement\n\n# 601.7 Trial Mixes\n\nThe Contractor shall make trial mixes of dry lean concrete with moisture contents like 5.0, 5.5, 6.0, 6.5 and 7.0 percent using specified cement content, specified aggregate grading and aggregate-cement ratio specified in Clause 601.3.1. Optimum moisture and density shall be established by preparing cubes with varying moisture contents. Compaction of the mix shall be done in three layers with vibratory hammer fitted with a square or rectangular foot as described in Clause 903.5.1.1. After establishing the optimum moisture, a set of six cubes shall be cast at optimum moisture for the determination of compressive strength on the third and the seventh day. Trial mixes shall be repeated if the strength is not satisfactory by increasing cement content. After the mix design is approved, the Contractor shall construct a trial section in accordance with Clause 601.8.\n\nIf during the construction of the trial length, the optimum moisture content determined as above is found to be unsatisfactory, the Contractor may make suitable changes in the moisture content to achieve the satisfactory mix. The cube specimens prepared with the changed mix content should satisfy the strength requirement.

All efforts shall be made to store the materials in proper places so as to prevent their deterioration or contamination by foreign matter and to ensure their satisfactory quality and fitness for the work. The platform where aggregates are stock piled shall be paved and elevated from the ground at least by 150 mm. The area shall have slope to drain off rain water. The storage space must also permit easy inspection, removal and storage of the materials. Aggregates of different sizes shall be stored in partitioned stack-yards.\n\n269\n\nSection 600 Concrete Pavement\n\nmaterials even though stored in approved godowns must be subjected to acceptance test as per Clause 903 of these Specifications prior to their use.\n\n# 602.3 Proportioning of Concrete\n\n# 602.3.1\n\nAfter approval by the Engineer of all the materials to be used in the concrete, the Contractor shall submit the mix design based on weighed proportions of all ingredients for the approval of the Engineer vide Clause 602.3.4. The mix design shall be submitted at least 30 days prior to the paving of trial length and the design shall be based on laboratory trial mixes using the approved materials and methods as per IRC:44 or IS:10262. The target mean strength for the design mix shall be determined as indicated in Clause 602.3.3.1. The mix design shall be based on the flexural strength of concrete.\n\n# 602.3.2 Cement Content\n\nWhen Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) is used the quantity of cement shall not be less than 360 kg/cu.m. In case fly ash grade I (as per IS:3812) is blended at site as part replacement of cement, the quantity of fly ash shall be up to 20 percent by weight of cementitious material and the quantity of OPC in such a blend shall not be less than 310 kg/cu.m. The minimum of OPC content, in case ground granulated blast furnace slag cement blended, shall also not be less than 310 kg/m\u00b3. If this minimum cement content is not sufficient to produce concrete of the specified strength, it shall be increased as necessary by the contractor at his own cost.\n\n# 602.3.3 Concrete Strength\n\n# 602.3.3.1\n\nThe characteristic flexural strength of concrete shall not be less than 4.5 MPa unless specified otherwise. Target mean flexural strength for mix design shall be more than 4.5 MPa + 1.65s, where s is standard deviation of flexural strength derived by conducting test on minimum 30 beams. While designing the mix in the laboratory, correlation between flexural and compressive strengths of concrete shall be established on the basis of at least thirty tests on specimens. However, quality control in the field shall be exercised on the basis of flexural strength. It may, however, be ensured that the materials and mix proportions remain substantially unaltered during the daily concrete production. The water content shall be the minimum required to provide the agreed workability for full compaction of the concrete to the required density as determined by the trial mixes or as approved by the Engineer and the maximum free water cement ratio shall be 0.45 when only OPC is used and 0.50 when blended cement (Portland Pozzolana Cement or Portland Slag Cement or OPC blended with fly ash or Ground Granulated Blast Furnace Slag, at site) is used.\n\n# 602.3.3.2\n\nThe ratio between the 7 and 28 day strength shall be established for the mix to be used in the slab in advance, by testing pairs of beams and cubes at each stage on at least six batches of trial mix. The average strength of the 7 day cured specimens shall be divided by the average strength of the 28 day specimens for each batch, and the ratio \u201cR\u2019 shall be determined. The ratio \u2018R\u2019 shall be expressed to three decimal places.\n\n270\n\nConcrete Pavement\n# Section 600\n\nIf during the construction of the trial length or during some normal working, the average value of any four consecutive 7 day test results falls below the required 7 day strength as derived from the value of \u2018R\u2019 then the cement content of the concrete shall, without extra payment, be increased by 5 percent by weight or by an amount agreed by the Engineer. The increased cement content shall be maintained at least until the four corresponding 28 day strengths have been assessed for in conformity with the requirements as per Clause 602.3.3.1. Whenever the cement content is increased, the concrete mix shall be adjusted to maintain the required workability.\n\n# 602.3.4 workability\n\n# 602.3.4.1\n\nThe workability of the concrete at the point of placing shall be adequate for the concrete to be fully compacted and finished without undue flow. The optimum workability for the mix to suit the paving plant being used shall be determined by the Contractor and approved by the Engineer. The control of workability in the field shall be exercised by the slump test as per IS:1199.\n\n# 602.3.4.2\n\nThe workability requirement at the batching and mixing plant and paving site shall be established by slump tests carried during trial paving. These requirements shall be established from season to season and also when the lead from batching and mixing plant site to the paving site changes. The workability shall be established for the type of paving equipment available. A slump value in the range of 25 \u00b1 15 mm is reasonable for paving works but this may be modified depending upon the site requirement and got approved by the Engineer. These tests shall be carried out on every tipping truck/dumper at batching and mixing plant site and paving site initially when the work commences but subsequently the frequency can be reduced to alternate tipping trucks or as per the instructions of the Engineer.\n\n# 602.3.5 design Mix\n\n# 602.3.5.1\n\nThe Contractor shall carry out laboratory trials of design mix with the materials from the approved sources to be used as per IRC:44. Trial mixes shall be made in presence of the Engineer or his representative and the design mix shall be subject to the approval of the Engineer. They shall be repeated, if necessary, until the proportions, that will produce a concrete which complies in all respects with these Specifications, and conform to the requirements of the design/drawings.\n\n# 602.3.5.2\n\nThe proportions determined as a result of the laboratory trial mixes may be adjusted, if necessary, during the construction of the trial length. Thereafter, neither the materials nor the mix proportions shall be varied in any way except with the written approval of the Engineer.\n\n271\n\nSection 600\n# Concrete Pavement\n\n# 602.3.5.3\n\nAny change in the source of materials or mix proportions proposed by the Contractor during the course of work shall be assessed by making laboratory trial mixes and the construction of a further trial length of length not less than 50 m unless approval is given by the Engineer for minor adjustments like compensation for moisture content in aggregates or minor fluctuations in the grading of aggregate.\n\n# 602.4\n\n# sub-base\n\nThe cement concrete pavement shall be laid over the sub-base constructed in accordance with the relevant drawings and Specifications. It shall be ensured that the sub-base is not damaged before laying the concrete pavement. If the dry lean concrete sub-base is found damaged at some places or it has cracks wider than 10 mm, it shall be repaired with fine cement concrete (aggregate size 10 mm and down) or bituminous concrete before laying separation membrane layer.\n\n# 602.5\n\n# separation Membrane\n\nA separation membrane shall be used between the concrete slab and the sub-base. Separation membrane shall be impermeable PVC sheet 125 micron thick transparent or white in colour laid flat with minimum creases. Before placing the separation membrane, the sub-base shall be swept clean of all the extraneous materials using air compressor. Wherever overlap of plastic sheets is necessary, the same shall be at least 300 mm and any damaged sheathing shall be replaced at the Contractor\u2019s cost. The separation membrane may be nailed to the lower layer with concrete nails. The separation membrane shall be omitted when two layers of wax-based curing compound is used.\n\n# 602.6\n\n# Joints\n\n# 602.6.1\n\nThe locations and type of joints shall be as shown in the drawing. Joints shall be constructed depending upon their functional requirement. The location of the joints should be transferred accurately at the site and mechanical saw cutting of joints done as per stipulated dimensions. It shall be ensured that the required depth of cut is made from edge-to-edge of the pavement. Transverse and longitudinal joints in the pavement and Dry Lean Concrete sub-base shall be staggered so that they are not coincident vertically and are at least 800 to 1000 mm and 300 to 400 mm apart respectively. Sawing of joints shall be carried out with diamond studded blades soon after the concrete has hardened to take the load of the sawing machine and crew members without damaging the texture of the pavement. Sawing operation could start as early as 4-8 hours after laying of concrete pavement but not later than 8 to 12 hours depending upon the ambient temperature, wind velocity, relative humidity and required maturity of concrete achieved for this purpose.\n\nWhen the kerb is cast integrally with the main pavement slab, the joint cutting shall also be extended to the kerb.\n\n272\n\nConcrete Pavement\n# Section 600\n\nWhere the use of maturity meter is specified, sawing should not be initiated when the compressive strength of the concrete is less than 2 MPa and should be completed before it attains the compressive strength of 7 MPa.\n\n# 602.6.2 Transverse Joints\n\n# 602.6.2.1\n\nTransverse joints shall be contraction, construction and expansion joints constructed at the spacing described in the drawings.

These joints shall be cut as soon as the concrete has undergone initial hardening and is hard enough to take the load of joint sawing machine without causing damage to the slab.\n\nContraction joints shall consist of a mechanical sawn joint groove, 3 to 5 mm wide and one-fourth to one-third depth of the slab \u00b1 5 mm or as stipulated in the drawings and dowel bars complying with Clause 602.6.5.\n\nContraction joint shall be widened subsequently to accommodate the sealant as per Clause 602.10, to dimensions shown on drawings or as per IRC:57.\n\n# 602.6.2.3 Expansion Joints\n\nThe expansion joint shall consist of a joint filler board complying with Clause 602.2.9 and dowel bars complying with Clause 602.6.5 and as detailed in the drawings. The filler board shall be positioned vertically with the prefabricated joint assemblies along the line of the\n\n273\n\nSection 600\n# Concrete Pavement\n\njoint within the tolerances given in Clause 602.6.2.1. The adjacent slabs shall be completely separated from each other by the joint filler board.\n\n# 602.6.3 Transverse construction Joint\n\nTransverse construction joint shall be placed whenever concreting is completed after a day\u2019s work or is suspended for more than 30 minutes. These joints shall be provided at location of contraction joints using dowel bars. If sufficient concrete has not been mixed to form a slab extending upto a contraction joint, and if an interruption occurs, the concrete placed shall be removed upto the last preceding joint and disposed of. At all construction joints, steel bulk heads shall be used to retain the concrete. The surface of the concrete laid subsequently shall conform to the grade and cross sections of the previously laid pavement. When positioning of bulk head/stop-end is not possible, concreting to an additional 1 or 2 m length may be carried out to enable the movement of joint cutting machine so that joint grooves may be cut and the extra 1 or 2 m length is cut out and removed subsequently after concrete has hardened. After minimum 14 days of curing, in case OPC cement is used and 16 days of curing when flyash or blended cement is used, the construction joint shall be widened to accommodate the sealant as per Clause 602.10 to dimensions shown on drawing or as per IRC:57.\n\n# 602.6.4 Longitudinal Joint\n\n# 602.6.4.1\n\nThe longitudinal joints shall be constructed by forming or by sawing as per details of the joints shown in the drawing. Sawed longitudinal joints shall be constructed when the concrete pavement placement width exceeds 4.5 m. The groove may be cut after the final set of the concrete. Joints should be sawn to at least one-third the depth of the slab \u00b15 mm as indicated in the drawing. The joint shall be widened subsequently to dimensions shown on the drawings.\n\nWhere adjacent lanes of pavement are constructed separately using slip form pavers or side forms, the tie bars may be bent at right angles against the vertical face/ side of the first lane constructed and straightened before placing concrete in the adjacent lane. Broken or damaged tie bars shall be repaired or replaced as required.\n\nThe groove for sealant shall be cut in the pavement lane placed later.\n\n# 602.6.4.2 Tie Bars\n\nTie bars shall be provided at the longitudinal joints as per dimensions and spacing shown in the drawing and in accordance with Clause 602.6.6. The direction of the tie bars at curves shall be radial in the direction of the radius.\n\n274\n\nConcrete Pavement\n# Section 600\n\n# 602.6.5 Dowel Bars\n\n# 602.6.5.1\n\nDowel bars shall be mild steel rounds in accordance with Clause 602.2.8 with details/dimensions as indicated in the drawings and free from oil, dirt, loose rust or scale. They shall be straight, free of irregularities and burring restricting slippage in the concrete. The sliding ends shall be sawn or cropped cleanly with no protrusions outside the normal diameter of the bar. Any protrusions shall be removed by grinding the ends of the dowel bars. The dowel bar shall be supported on cradles/dowel chairs in pre-fabricated joint assemblies positioned prior to the construction of the slabs or mechanically inserted with vibration into the plastic concrete by a method which ensures correct placement of the bars besides full re-compaction of the concrete around the dowel bars.\n\n# 602.6.5.2\n\nUnless shown otherwise on the drawings, dowel bars shall be positioned at mid depth of the slab within a tolerance of \u00b120 mm, and centered equally about intended lines of the joint within a tolerance of \u00b125 mm. They shall be aligned parallel to the finished surface of the slab and to the centre line of the carriageway and to each other within tolerances given here-in-under, the compliance of which shall be checked as per Clause 602.11.7.\n\n- For bars supported on cradles prior to the laying of the slab:\n- - a) All bars in a joint shall be within \u00b12 mm per 300 mm length of bar\n- b) 2/3rd of the number of bars shall be within \u00b13 mm per 500 mm length of bar\n- c) No bar shall differ in alignment from an adjoining bar by more than 3 mm per 300 mm length of bar in either the horizontal or vertical plane\n- d) Cradles supporting dowel bar shall not extend across the line of joint i.e. no steel bar of the cradle assembly shall be continuous across the joint.\n\nFor all bars inserted after laying of the slab except those inserted by a Dowel Bar Inserter the tolerance for alignment may be twice as indicated in (i) above. The transverse joints at curves shall be radial in the direction of the radius.\n\n# 602.6.5.3\n\nDowel bars, supported on cradles in assemblies, when subject to a load of 110 N applied at either end and in either the vertical or horizontal direction (upwards and downwards and in both directions horizontally) shall conform to be within the limits given in Clause 602.6.5.2.\n\n# 602.6.5.4\n\nThe assembly of dowel bars and supporting cradles, including the joint filler\n\n275\n\nSection 600 Concrete Pavement\n\nboard in the case of expansion joints, shall have the following degree of rigidity when fixed in position:\n\n1. For expansion joints, the deflection of the top edge of the filler board shall be not greater than 13 mm, when a load of 1.3 kN is applied perpendicular to the vertical face of the joint filler board and distributed over a length of 600 mm by means of a bar or timber packing, at mid depth and midway between individual fixings, or 300 mm from either end of any length of filler board, if a continuous fixing is used. The residual deflection after load shall be not more than 3 mm.\n2. The fixings for joint assembly shall not fail under 1.3 kN load and shall fail before the load reaches 2.6 kN when applied over a length of 600 mm by means of a bar or timber packing placed as near to the level of the line of fixings as practicable.\n3. Fixings shall be deemed to fail when there is displacement of the assemblies by more than 3 mm with any form of fixing, under the test load. The displacement shall be measured at the nearest part of the assembly to the centre of the bar or timber packing.\n\n602.6.5.5 Dowel bars in the contraction joints, construction joints and expansion joints shall be covered by a thin plastic sheath. The thickness of the sheath shall not exceed 0.5 mm and shall be tightly fitted on the bar for at least two-thirds of the length from one end for dowel bars in contraction/construction joints and half the length plus 50 mm for expansion joints. The sheathed bar shall comply with the following pull-out tests:\n\nFour bars shall be taken at random from stock and without any special preparation shall be covered by sheaths as required in this Clause. The ends of the dowel bars which have been sheathed shall be cast centrally into concrete specimens 150 mm x 150 mm x 600 mm, made of the same mix proportions to be used in the pavement, but with a maximum nominal aggregate size of 20 mm and cured in accordance with IS:516. At 7 days a tensile load shall be applied to achieve a movement of the bar of at least 0.25 mm. The average bond stress to achieve this movement shall not be greater than 0.14 MPa.\n\n602.6.5.6 For expansion joints, a closely fitting cap 100 mm long consisting of waterproofed cardboard or an approved synthetic material like PVC or GI pipe shall be placed over the sheathed end of each dowel bar. An expansion space (about 25 mm) at least equal in length to the thickness of the joint filler board shall be formed between the end of the cap and the end of the dowel bar by using compressible sponge.

The coating shall be dry when the tie bars are used. In the case of coastal region and high rainfall areas, tie bars shall be epoxy coated in their full length as per IS:13620.\n\n# 602.6.6.3\n\nTie bars in longitudinal joints shall be made up into rigid assemblies with adequate supports and fixings to remain firmly in position during the construction of the slab. Alternatively, tie bars at longitudinal joints may be mechanically or manually inserted into the plastic concrete from above by vibration using a method which ensures correct placements of the bars and recompaction of the concrete around the tie bars.\n\n# 602.6.6.4\n\nTie bars shall be positioned to remain in the middle from the top or within the upper middle third of the slab depth as indicated in the drawings and approximately parallel to the surface and approximately perpendicular to the line of the joint, with the centre of each bar on the intended line of the joints within a tolerance of \u00b150 mm, and with a minimum cover of 30 mm below the joint groove. Spacing of tie bars on curves of radius less than 360 m shall not be less than 350 mm.\n\n# 602.6.6.5\n\nTo check the position of the tie bars, one metre length, 0.5 m on either side of the longitudinal joint shall be opened when the concrete is green (within 20 to 30 minutes).

However, when concrete is being placed during monsoon months and when it may be expected to rain, sufficient supply of tarpaulin or other waterproof cloth shall be provided along the line of the work. Any time when it rains, all freshly laid concrete which had not been covered for curing purposes shall be adequately protected. Any concrete damaged by rain shall be removed and replaced. If the damage is limited to texture, it shall be retextured in accordance with the directions of the Engineer.\n\n# 602.7.2\n\ntemperature limitation\n\nNo concreting shall be done when the temperature of the concrete reaching the paving site is above 30\u00b0C. Besides, in adverse conditions like high temperature, low relative humidity, excessive wind velocity, imminence of rains etc., tents on mobile trusses may be provided over the freshly laid concrete for a minimum period of 3 hours as directed by the Engineer. To bring down the temperature, if necessary, chilled water or ice flakes should be made use of. When the ambient temperature is more than 35\u00baC, no concreting shall be permitted.\n\n277\n\nSection 600\n# Concrete Pavement\n\nFlakes should not be manufactured from chlorinated water. Generally, the rate of evaporation of water shall not exceed 1 kg/sqm/hour as per IRC:15.\n\nNo concreting shall be done when the concrete temperature is below 5\u00baC and the temperature is further falling.\n\n# 602.8 Fixed Form Paving\n\n# 602.8.1 Side Forms and Rails\n\nThese shall be provided in case of fixed form paving.

They shall be sufficiently robust and rigid to support the weight and pressure caused by paving equipment. Side forms for use with wheeled paving machines shall incorporate metal rails firmly fixed at a constant height below the top of the forms. The forms and rails shall be firmly secured in position by not less than 3 stakes/pins for every 3 m length so as to prevent movement in any direction. Forms and rails shall be straight within a tolerance of 3 mm in 3 m and when in place shall not settle in excess of 1.5 mm in 3 m while paving is being done. Forms shall be cleaned and oiled immediately before each use. The forms shall be bedded on a continuous bed of low moisture content lean cement mortar or concrete and set to the line and levels shown on the drawings within tolerances \u00b110 mm and \u00b13 mm respectively. The bedding shall not extend under the slab and there shall be no vertical step between adjacent forms of more than 3 mm. The forms shall be got inspected by the Engineer for his approval 12 hours before construction of the slab and shall not be removed until at least 12 hours afterwards. No concreting shall commence till formwork has been approved by the Engineer.\n\n# 602.8.2\n\nAt all times sufficient forms shall be used and set to the required alignment for at least 300 m length of pavement immediately in advance of the paving operations, or the anticipated length of pavement to be laid within the next 24 hours whichever is more.\n\n# 602.8.3 Slip Form Paving\n\n# 602.8.3.1 Use of Guidewires\n\nWhere slip form paving is proposed, a guidewire shall be provided along both sides of the slab. Each guidewire shall be at a constant height above and parallel to the required edges of the slab as described in the contract drawing within a vertical tolerance of \u00b13 mm. Additionally, one of the wires shall be kept at a constant horizontal distance from the required edge of the pavement as indicated in the contract drawing within a lateral tolerance of \u00b110 mm.\n\n278\n\nConcrete Pavement\n# Section 600\n\n# 602.8.3.2\n\nThe guidewires shall be supported on stakes 5\u20136 m apart by connectors capable of fine horizontal and vertical adjustment.

However, the guidewire shall be erected and tensioned on the connectors at any section for at least 2 hours before concreting that section.\n\n# 602.8.3.4\n\nThe Contractor shall submit to the Engineer for his approval of line and level, the stakes and connectors which are ready for use in the length of road to be constructed next day. Such approval shall be obtained at least 12 hours before commencement of paving operation. Any deficiencies noted by the Engineer shall be rectified by the Contractor who shall then re-apply for approval of the affected stakes. Work shall not proceed until the Engineer has given his approval. It shall be ensured that the stakes and guidewires are not affected by the construction equipment when concreting is in progress.\n\n# 602.9 construction\n\n# 602.9.1 general\n\nA systems approach may be adopted for construction of the pavement, and the Method Statement for carrying out the work, detailing all the activities, indication of time-cycle, equipment, personnel etc., shall be got approved from the Engineer before the commencement of the work.

The concreting should proceed continuously without stops and starts.\n\n# 602.9.2 Batching and Mixing\n\nBatching and mixing of the concrete shall be done at a central batching and mixing plant with automatic controls, located at a suitable place which takes into account sufficient space for stockpiling of cement, aggregates and stationary water tanks. This shall be located at an approved distance, duly considering the properties of the mix and the transporting arrangements available with the Contractor.\n\n279\n\nSection 600\n# Concrete Pavement\n\n# 602.9.3 Equipment for Proportioning of Materials and Paving\n\n# 602.9.3.1\n\nProportioning of materials shall be done in the batching plant by weight, each type of material being weighed separately. The cement from the bulk stock may be weighed separately from the aggregates. Water shall be measured by volume. Specified percentage of plasticizer in volume will be added by weight of cement. Wherever properly graded aggregate of uniform quality cannot be maintained as envisaged in the mix design, the grading of aggregates shall be controlled by appropriate blending techniques. The capacity of batching and mixing plant shall be at least 25 percent higher than the proposed capacity of the laying/paving equipment.\n\n# 602.9.3.2 Batching Plant and Equipment\n\n1. General: The batching plant shall include minimum four bins, weighing hoppers, and scales for the fine aggregates and for each size of coarse aggregate. If cement is used in bulk, a separate scale for cement shall be included. There shall be a separate bin for flyash, if this additive is specified. The weighing hoppers shall be properly sealed and vented to preclude dust during operation. Approved safety devices shall be provided and maintained for the protection of all personnel engaged in plant operation, inspection and testing. The batch plant shall be equipped with a suitable non-resettable batch counter which will correctly indicate the number of batches proportioned. A continuous type of mixing plant can also be used provided the ingredients are weighed through electronic sensors before feeding.\n2. Automatic Weighing Devices: Batching plant shall be equipped to proportion aggregates and bulk cement by means of automatic weighing devices using load cells. The weighing devices shall have an accuracy within \u00b11% in respect of quantity of cement, admixtures and water and \u00b12% in respect of aggregates and the accuracy shall be checked at least once a month.\n3. Mixer: Mixers shall be pan type, reversible type or any other mixer capable of combining the aggregates, cement, and water into a thoroughly mixed and uniform mass within the specified mixing period, and of discharging the mix, without segregation. Each stationary mixer shall be equipped with an approved timing device which will automatically lock the discharge lever when the drum has been charged and release it at the end of the mixing period. The device shall be equipped with a bell or other suitable warning device adjusted to give a clearly audible signal each time the lock is released. In case of failure of the timing device, the mixer may be used for the balance of the day while it is being repaired, provided that each batch is mixed in 90 seconds or as per the manufacturer\u2019s recommendation. The mixer shall be equipped with a\n\n\n\nConcrete Pavement\n# Section 600\n\nSuitable non-resettable batch counter which shall correctly indicate the number of batches mixed. The mixer shall be cleaned at suitable intervals. The pick-up and throw-over blades in the drum or drums shall be repaired or replaced when they are worn down 20 mm or more. The Contractor shall (1) have available at the job site a copy of the manufacturer\u2019s design, showing dimensions and arrangements of blades in reference to original height and depth, or (2) provide permanent marks on blade to show points of 20 mm wear from new conditions. Drilled holes of 5 mm diameter near each end and at midpoint of each blade are recommended. Batching Plant shall be calibrated in the beginning and thereafter at suitable interval not exceeding 1 month.\n\n# 4) Control Cabin\n\nAn air-conditioned centralized computer control cabin shall be provided for automatic operation of the equipment.\n\n# 5) Design Features\n\nThe design features of the batching plant should be such that it can be shifted quickly.\n\n# 602.9.3.3 Paving Equipment\n\nThe concrete shall be placed with an approved fixed form or slip form paver with independent units designed to (i) spread, (ii) consolidate, screed and float-finish, (iii) texture and cure the freshly placed concrete in one complete pass of the machine in such a manner that a minimum of hand finishing will be necessary and so as to provide a dense and homogeneous pavement in conformity with the plans and Specifications. The paver shall be equipped with electronic sensor controls to control the line and grade from either one side or both sides of the machine.\n\nVibrators shall operate at a frequency of 8000-10000 impulses per minute under load at a maximum spacing of 600 mm.

The saw machine shall be either electric or petrol/diesel driven type. A water tank with flexible hose and pump shall be made available for this activity on priority basis. The Contractor shall have at least one standby saw in good working condition. The concreting work shall not commence if the saws are not in working condition.\n\n# 602.9.4 Hauling and Placing of Concrete\n\n# 602.9.4.1 Freshly Mixed Concrete\n\nFreshly mixed concrete from the central batching and mixing plant shall be\n\n\n\nSection 600\n# Concrete Pavement\n\ntransported to the paver site by means of tipping trucks or transit mixers of sufficient capacity and approved design in sufficient numbers to ensure a constant supply of concrete. Covers shall be used for protection of concrete against the weather. While loading the concrete truck shall be moved back and forth under the discharge chute to prevent segregation. The tipping trucks shall be capable of maintaining the mixed concrete in a homogeneous state and discharging the same without segregation and loss of cement slurry. The feeding to the paver is to be regulated in such a way that the paving is done in an uninterrupted manner with a uniform speed throughout the day\u2019s work. Tipping trucks shall be washed at a regular frequency as prescribed by the Engineer to ensure that no left-over mix of previous loading remains stuck.\n\n# 602.9.4.2 Placing of Concrete\n\nThe total time taken from the addition of the water to the mix, until the completion of the surface finishing and texturing shall not exceed 120 minutes when concrete temperature is less than 25\u00baC and 90 minutes when the concrete temperature is between 25\u00baC and 30\u00baC. When the time between mixing and laying exceed these values, the concrete shall be rejected and removed from the site. Tipping trucks delivering concrete shall normally not run on plastic sheathing nor shall they run on completed slabs until after 28 days of placing the concrete.\n\nThe placing of concrete in front of the PQC paver should preferably be from the side placer to avoid damage to DLC by concrete tipping trucks. In case of unavoidable situation, truck supplying concrete to the paver may be allowed to ply on the DLC with the approval of the Engineer. The paver shall be capable of paving the carriageway as shown in the drawings, in a single pass and lift.\n\n# 602.9.4.3\n\nWhere fixed form pavers are to be used, forms shall be fixed in advance as per Clause 602.8. Before any paving is done, the site shall be shown to the Engineer, in order to verify the arrangement for paving besides placing of dowels, tie-bars etc., as per the relevant Clauses of these Specifications. The mixing and placing of concrete shall progress only at such a rate as to permit proper finishing, protecting and curing of the concrete in the pavement.\n\n# 602.9.4.4\n\nIn areas inaccessible to paving equipment, the pavement shall be constructed using side forms, as per Clause 602.9.7.\n\n# 602.9.4.5\n\nIn all cases, the temperature of the concrete shall be measured at the point of discharge from the delivery vehicle.\n\n# 602.9.4.6\n\nThe addition of water to the surface of the concrete to facilitate the finishing operations will not be permitted except with the approval of the Engineer when it shall be applied as a mist by means of approved equipment.\n\n282\n\nConcrete Pavement\n# Section 600\n\n602.9.4.7 If considered necessary by the Engineer, the paving machines shall be provided with approved covers to protect the surface of the slab under construction from direct sunlight and rain or hot wind.\n\n602.9.4.8 While the concrete is still plastic, its surface shall be textured by brush or tines as per the instructions of the engineer in compliance with Clause 602.9.11. The surface and edges of the slab shall be cured by the application of a sprayed liquid curing membrane in compliance with Clause 602.9.12. After the surface texturing, but before the curing compound is applied, the concrete slab shall be marked with the chainage at every 100 m interval by embossing.\n\n602.9.4.9 As soon as the side forms are removed, edges of the slabs shall be corrected wherever irregularities have occurred by using fine concrete composed of 1:1:2, cement : sand : coarse agg (10 mm down) with water cement ratio not more than 0.4 under the supervision of the Engineer.\n\n602.9.4.10 If the requirement of Clause 902.4. for surface regularity fails to be achieved on two consecutive working days, then normal working shall cease until the cause of the excessive irregularity has been identified and remedied.\n\n# 602.9.5 construction by slip form paver\n\n602.9.5.1 The slip form paving train shall consist of a power machine which spreads, compacts and finishes the concrete in a continuous operation. The slip form paving machine shall compact the concrete by internal vibration and shape it between the side forms with either a conforming plate or by vibrating and oscillating finishing beams. The concrete shall be deposited without segregation in front of slip form paver across the whole width and to a height which at all times is in excess of the required surcharge. The deposited concrete shall be struck off to the necessary average and differential surcharge by means of the strike off plate or a screw auger device extending across the whole width of the slab. The equipment for striking-off the concrete shall be capable of being rapidly adjusted for changes of the average and differential surcharge necessitated by change in slab thickness or crossfall.\n\n602.9.5.2 The level of the conforming plate and finishing beams shall be controlled automatically from the guide wires installed as per Clause 602.8 by sensors attached at the four corners of the slip form paving machine. The alignment of the paver shall be controlled automatically from the guide wire by at least one set of sensors attached to the paver. The alignment and level of ancillary machines for finishing, texturing and curing of the concrete shall be automatically controlled relative to the guide wire or to the surface and edge of the slab.\n\n602.9.5.3 Slip-form paving machines shall have vibrators of variable output, with a\n\n283\n\nSection 600\n# Concrete Pavement\n\nmaximum energy output of not less than 2.5 KW per metre width of slab per 300 mm depth of slab for a laying speed upto 1.5 m per minute. The machines shall be of sufficient mass to provide adequate reaction during spreading and paving operations on the traction units to maintain forward movements during the placing of concrete in all situations. Normal paving speed shall be maintained as per Clause 602.9.1.\n\n# 602.9.5.4\n\nIf the edges of the slip formed slab slump to the extent that the surface of the top edge of the slab does not comply with the requirements of Clause 902.3, the work shall be stopped until such time as the Contractor can demonstrate his ability to slip form the edges to the required levels. The deficient edge shall be temporarily supported by a side form and the thickness deficiency shall be made good by adding fresh concrete to the newly formed edge and compacting.\n\n# 602.9.5.5\n\nSlip-form pavers with adequate width to pave the entire carriageway width in one go shall be employed unless specified in the Contract. In situations where full-width paving is not possible, paving in part widths may be permitted by the Engineer. Paving in part will be avoided, except in unavoidable circumstances. In case of part width paving, care shall be taken to ensure that while laying the next lane, bond between the remaining half length of tie bar or subsequently inserted tie bars and the newly laid concrete is adequately developed. Care shall be taken to avoid damage to the previous lane.\n\n# 602.9.5.6\n\nIn case paving in separate lanes is allowed, work on the adjacent lane shall be permitted when the previously paved lane is cured for at least 14 days and is in a position to bear the weight of paving machine. When the wheels or crawler tracks are to ply on the already paved surface, necessary precautions shall be taken by placing protective pads of rubber or similar material so that texture is not damaged. The wheel or track shall be reasonably away from the edge to avoid damage to the previously laid slab.\n\n# 602.9.5.7\n\ntube floating\n\nUpon the instructions of the Engineer, Contractor shall scrape the concrete surface when in plastic state with a 3 m long tube float fixed with a long and stable handle before texturing. Tube float shall be of an alloy steel tube of 50 to 60 mm diameter with a long and stable handle. The length of tube float shall preferably be longer than half the length of slab i.e., half the distance between two transverse contraction joints. This operation shall be done to minimise surface irregularity caused due to varied causes like frequent stoppages of work, surface deformation due to plastic flow etc. The tube float shall be placed at the centre of the slab parallel to longitudinal joint and pulled slowly and uniformly towards the edges. After the use of float tube, it shall be frequently cleaned before further use. The slurry removed shall be discarded. This activity shall be advanced laterally by providing an overlap of half the length of tube float. The removal of the cement slurry from the surface shall be sufficient enough such that the texture is formed on a firm surface and is more durable. This operation, however, shall be carried out after removing bleeding water.\n\n284\n\nConcrete Pavement                                                              Section 600\n\n# 602.9.6 construction by fixed form paver\n\n# 602.9.6.1\n\nThe fixed form paving train shall consist of separate powered machines which spread, compact and finish the concrete in a continuous operation.\n\n# 602.9.6.2\n\nThe concrete shall be discharged without segregation into a hopper spreader which is equipped with means for controlling its rate of deposition on to the sub-base. The spreader shall be operated to strike off concrete up to a level requiring a small amount of cutting down by the distributor of the spreader. The distributor of spreader shall strike off the concrete to the surcharge adequate to ensure that the vibratory compactor thoroughly compacts the layer. If necessary, poker vibrators shall be used adjacent to the side forms and edges of the previously constructed slab. The vibratory compactor shall be set to strike off the surface slightly high so that it is cut down to the required level by the oscillating beam. The machine shall be capable of being rapidly adjusted for changes in average and differential surcharge necessitated by changes in slab thickness or crossfall. The final finisher shall be able to finish the surface to the required level and smoothness as specified, care being taken to avoid bringing up of excessive mortar to the surface by over working.\n\n# 602.9.7 semi-mechanised construction\n\nAreas in which hand-guided methods of construction become indispensable shall be got approved by the Engineer in writing in advance. Such work may be permitted only in restricted areas in small lengths. Work shall be carried out by skilled personnel as per methods approved by the Engineer. The acceptance criteria regarding level, thickness, surface regularity, texture, finish, strength, of concrete and all other quality control measures shall be the same as in the case of machine laid work. Guidelines on the use of plants, equipment, tools, hauling of mix, compaction floating, straight edging, texturing, edging etc. shall be as per IRC:15.\n\n# 602.9.8 transition slabs\n\nAt the interface of rigid and flexible pavement, at least 3 m long reinforced buried slab shall be provided to give a long lasting joint at the interface. The details shall be as given in IRC:15.\n\n# 602.9.9 anchor Beam and terminal slab Beam adjoining Bridge structures\n\nRCC anchor beams shall be provided in the terminal slab adjoining bridge structures as per drawings and IRC:15.\n\n# 602.9.10 the treatment of concrete pavement on culverts\n\nThe concrete pavement shall be taken over the culverts. At both ends of the culvert slab, a contraction joint shall be provided in the concrete pavement. Nominal reinforcement of\n\n285\n\nSection 600                                                            Concrete Pavement\n10 mm dia bars at 150 mm spacing in both directions shall be provided at 50 mm below the top of the slab. The reinforcement shall be stopped 50 mm short of the contraction joint. Such reinforcement shall also be provided in the next slab panel on either side.\n\n# 602.9.11        surface texture\n\n# 602.9.11.1      tining\n\nAfter final floating and finishing of the slab and before application of the liquid curing membrane, the surface of concrete slabs shall be textured either in the transverse direction (i.e., at right angles to the longitudinal axis of the road) or in longitudinal direction (i.e., parallel to the centreline of the roadway). The texturing shall be done by tining the finished concrete surface by using rectangular steel tines. A beam or a bridge mounted with steel tines shall be equipped and operated with automatic sensing and control devices from main paver or auxiliary unit. The tining unit shall have facility for adjustment of the download pressure on the tines as necessary to produce the desired finish. The tining rakes shall be cleaned often to remove snots of slurry. The tines shall be inspected daily and all the damaged and bent tines shall be replaced before commencing texturing. Tined grooves shall be 3 mm wide and 3 to 4 mm deep. Before commencing texturing, the bleeding water, if any, shall be removed and texturing shall be done on a firm surface. The measurement of texture depth shall be done as per Clause 602.12.\n\n- a)     transverse tining : When the texturing is specified in transverse direction, a beam of at least 3 m length mounted with tines shall be moved in transverse direction to produce the texture. The grooves produced shall be at random spacing of grooves but uniform in width and depth. The spacing shall conform to a pattern shown below:\n\n|    | random spacing in mm |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |\n| -- | -------------------- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |\n| 10 | 14                   | 16 | 11 | 10 | 13 | 15 | 16 | 11 | 10 | 21 | 13 | 10 |\n\nThe above pattern shall be repeated. Texturing shall be done at the right time such that the grooves after forming shall not close and they shall not get roughened. Swerving of groove patterns will not be permitted. The completed textured surface shall be uniform in appearance.\n- b)     longitudinal tining : Longitudinal tining shall be done, if specified in the Contract. The texturing bridge shall be wide enough to cover the entire width of the carriageway but within 75 mm from the pavement edge. The centre to centre spacing between the tines shall be 18 to 21 mm. The width of tine texture shall be 3 mm and depth shall be 3 to 4 mm.\n\n286\n\nConcrete Pavement\n# Section 600\n\n# 602.9.11.2 Brush texturing\n\nAlternatively on the instructions of the Engineer, the brush texturing shall be applied. The brushed surface texture shall be applied evenly across the slab in one direction by the use of a wire brush not less than 450 mm wide but wider brushes normally of 3 m length are preferred. The brush shall be made of 32 gauge tape wires grouped together in tufts placed at 10 mm centres. The tufts shall contain an average of 14 wires and initially be 100 mm long. The brush shall have two rows of tufts. The rows shall be 20 mm apart and the tufts in one row shall be opposite the centre of the gap between tufts in the other row. The brush shall be replaced when the shortest tuft wears down to 90 mm long.\n\nThe texture depth shall be determined by the Sand Patch Test as described in the Clause 602.12. This test shall be performed at least once for each day\u2019s paving and wherever the Engineer considers it necessary at times after construction as under:\n\nFive individual measurements of the texture depth shall be taken at least 2 m apart anywhere along a diagonal line across a lane width between points 50 m apart along the pavement. No measurement shall be taken within 300 mm of the longitudinal edges of a concrete slab constructed in one pass.\n\nTexture depths shall not be less than the minimum required depth when measurements are taken as given in Table 600-5 nor greater than an average of 1.25 mm.\n\n# Table 600-5: Texture Depth\n\n| Time of Test                                                                                                  | Number of Measurements       | Required Texture Depth (mm) |                 |           |       |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------- | --------------- | --------- | ----- |\n|                                                                                                               |                              |                             | Specified Value | Tolerance |       |\n| 1) Between 24 hours and 7 days after the construction of the slab or until the slab is first used by vehicles | An average of 5 measurements | 1.00                        | \u00b10.25           |           |       |\n| 2) Not later than 6 weeks before the road is opened to traffic                                                | An average of 5 measurements |                             | 1.00            | +0.25     | -0.35 |\n\nAfter the application of the brushed texture, the surface of the slab shall have a uniform appearance.\n\nWhere the texture depth requirements are found to be deficient, the Contractor shall make good the texture across the full lane width over the length directed by the Engineer, by retexturing the hardened concrete surface in an approved manner.\n\n# 602.9.12 Curing\n\n# 602.9.12.1\n\nImmediately after the surface texturing, the surface and sides of the slab shall be cured by the application of approved resin-based aluminized reflective curing compound which hardens into an impervious film or membrane with the help of mechanical sprayer.\n\n287\n\nSection 600\n# Concrete Pavement\n\n# 602.9.12.2\n\nThe curing compound shall not react chemically with the concrete and the film or membrane shall not crack, peel or disintegrate within three weeks of application. Immediately prior to use, the curing compound shall be thoroughly agitated in its containers. The rate of spread shall be in accordance with the manufacturer\u2019s instructions checked during the construction of the trial length and subsequently whenever required by the Engineer. The mechanical sprayer shall incorporate an efficient mechanical device for continuous agitation and mixing of the compound during spraying. The curing compound shall be sprayed in two applications to ensure uniform spread.\n\nCuring compounds shall contain sufficient flake aluminum in finely divided dispersion to produce a complete coverage of the sprayed surface with a metallic finish. The compound shall become stable and impervious to evaporation of water from the surface of the concrete within 60 minutes of application and shall be of approved type. The curing compounds shall have a water retention efficiency index not less than 90 percent in accordance with BS Specification No. 7542 or as per ASTM C-309-81 Type 2.\n\n# 602.9.12.3\n\nIn addition to spraying of curing compound, the fresh concrete surface shall be protected for at least 3 hours by covering the finished concrete pavement with tents mounted on mobile trusses as described in Clause 602.7.2, during adverse weather conditions as directed by the Engineer. After three hours, the pavement shall be covered by moist hessian laid in two layers and the same shall then be kept damp for a minimum period of 14 days after which time the hessian may be removed. The hessian shall be kept continuously moist. All damaged/torn hessian shall be removed and replaced by new hessian on a regular basis.\n\n# 602.9.12.4\n\nThe Contractor shall be liable at his cost to replace any concrete damaged as a result of incomplete curing or cracked on a line other than that of a joint as per procedure in IRC:SP:83.\n\n# 602.10\n\n# Preparation and Sealing of Joint Grooves\n\n# 602.10.1\n\nGeneral\n\nAll joints shall be sealed using sealants described in Clause 602.2.10.\n\n# 602.10.2\n\nPreparation of Joint Grooves for Sealing\n\n# 602.10.2.1\n\nGrooves are saw cut in the first instance just to provide minimum width (3-5 mm) to facilitate development of crack at joint locations, as shown in the drawing. Subsequently before sealing, grooves are widened by sawing as per the dimensions in the drawing. Dimension of the grooves shall be controlled by depth/width gauge.\n\n# 602.10.2.2\n\nIf rough arrises develop when grooves are made, they shall be ground to provide a chamfer approximately 5 mm wide. If the groove is at an angle up to 10\u00ba from the perpendicular to the surface, the overhanging edge of the groove shall be sawn or ground perpendicular. If spalling occurs or the angle of the former is greater than 10 degree, the\n\n288\n\nConcrete Pavement\n# Section 600\n\nThe joint sealing groove shall be sawn wider and perpendicular to the surface to encompass the defects up to a maximum width, including any chamfer, of 20 mm for transverse joints and 10 mm for longitudinal joints. If the spalling cannot be so eliminated then the arises shall be repaired by an approved thin bonded arrises repair using cementitious/epoxy mortar materials.\n\n# 602.10.2.3\n\nAll grooves shall be cleaned of any dirt or loose material by air blasting with filtered, oil-free compressed air. The Engineer shall instruct cleaning by pressurized water jets. Depending upon the requirement of the sealant manufacturer, the sides of the grooves shall be sand blasted to increase the bondage between sealant and concrete.\n\n# 602.10.2.4\n\nThe groove shall be cleaned and dried at the time of priming and sealing. If sand blasting is recommended by the supplier, the same shall be carried out.\n\n# 602.10.2.5\n\nBefore sealing the temporary seal provided for blocking the ingress of dirt, soil etc., shall be removed. A highly compressible heat resistant paper-backed debonding strip as per drawing shall be inserted in the groove to serve the purpose of breaking the bond between sealant and the bottom of the groove and to plug the joint groove so that the sealant may not leak through the cracks. The width of debonding strip shall be more than the joint groove width so that it is held tightly in the groove. In the case of longitudinal joints, heat resistant tapes may be inserted to block the leakage through the bottom of the joint where hot poured sealant is used. When cold poured sealant is used a debonding tape of 1.0-2.0 mm thickness and 6 to 8 mm width shall be inserted to plug the groove so that the sealant does not enter in the initially cut groove.\n\n# 602.10.3\n\n# sealing with sealants\n\n# 602.10.3.1\n\nWhen sealants are applied, an appropriate primer shall also be used if recommended by the manufacturer and it shall be applied in accordance with his instructions. The sealant shall be applied within the minimum and maximum drying times of the primer recommended by the manufacturer. Priming and sealing with applied sealants shall not be carried out when the naturally occurring temperature in the joint groove to be sealed, is below 7\u00baC.\n\n# 602.10.3.2\n\nIf hot applied sealant is used it shall be heated and applied from a thermostatically controlled, indirectly heated preferably with oil jacketed melter and pourer having recirculating pump and extruder. For large road projects, sealant shall be applied with extruder having flexible hose and nozzle. The sealant shall not be heated to a temperature higher than the safe heating temperature and not for a period longer than the safe heating period, as specified by the manufacturer. The dispenser shall be cleaned out at the end of each day in accordance with the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations and reheated material shall not be used. The Movement Accommodation Factor of the sealant shall be more than 10 percent.\n\n# 602.10.3.3\n\nCold applied sealants with chemical formulation like polysulphide/polyurethane/silicone as per IRC:57 shall be used. These shall be mixed and applied within.\n\n\n\nSection 600 Concrete Pavement\n\nthe time limit specified by the manufacturer. If primers are recommended they shall be applied neatly with an appropriate brush. The Movement Accommodation Factor shall be more than 25 percent.\n\n# 602.10.3.4\n\nThe sealants applied at contraction phase of the slabs would result in bulging of the sealant over and above the slab. Therefore, the Contractor in consultation with the Engineer, shall establish the right temperature and time for applying the sealant. Thermometer shall be hung on a pole at the site for facilitating control during the sealing operation.\n\n# 602.10.3.5\n\nSealant shall be applied, slightly to a lower level than the slab with a tolerance of 3 \u00b1 1 mm.\n\n# 602.10.3.6\n\nDuring sealing operation, it shall be seen that no air bubbles are introduced in the sealant either by vapours or by the sealing process. The sealant after pouring, shall be allowed to cure for 7 days or for a period as per instructions of manufacturers.\n\n# 602.11 trial length\n\n# 602.11.1\n\nThe trial shall be constructed at least one month in advance of the proposed start of concrete paving work. At least one month prior to the construction of the trial length, the Contractor shall submit for the Engineer\u2019s approval a detailed method statement giving description of the proposed materials, plant, equipment and construction methods. All the major equipments like paving train, batching plant, tipping trucks etc., proposed in the construction are to be approved by the Engineer before their procurement. No trials of new materials, plant, equipment or construction methods, nor any development of them shall be permitted either during the construction of trial length or in any subsequent paving work, unless they form part of further trials. The trial lengths shall be constructed away from the carriageway.\n\n# 602.11.2\n\nThe Contractor shall demonstrate the materials, plant, equipment and methods of construction that are proposed for concrete paving, by first constructing a trial length of slab, at least 100 m long for mechanised construction and at least 50 m long for hand guided methods. The width of the trial section shall be the full carriageway width as shown in the drawings. If the first trial is unsatisfactory, the Contractor shall have to demonstrate his capability to satisfactorily construct the pavement in subsequent trials.\n\n# 602.11.3\n\nThe trial length shall be constructed in two parts over a period comprising at least part of two separate working days, with a minimum of 50 m constructed each day for mechanised construction and a minimum of 25 m on each day for hand guided construction. The trial length shall be constructed at a paving rate which is proposed for the main work.\n\n# 602.11.4\n\nTransverse joints including expansion joint and longitudinal joint that are proposed in the main work shall be constructed and assessed in the trial length.\n\n# 602.11.5\n\nThe trial length shall comply with the Specifications in all respects including the test requirement of Table 900-6 with the following additions.\n\n290\n\nConcrete Pavement\n# Section 600\n\n# 602.11.5.1 Surface Levels and Regularity\n\na) In checking for compliance with Clause 902.3 the levels shall be taken at intervals at the locations specified in this Clause along any line or lines parallel to the longitudinal centre line of the trial length.\n\nb) The maximum number of permitted irregularities of pavement surface shall comply with the requirements of Clause 902.4. Shorter trial lengths shall be assessed pro-rata based on values for a 300 m length.\n\n# 602.11.5.2 Joints\n\na) Alignment of dowel bars shall be inspected in any two consecutive transverse joints in a trial length construction by removing the fresh concrete in a width of 0.5 m on either side of the joint. The joint pit shall be refilled with freshly prepared concrete, after inspection. Alternatively, it can be tested by suitable device like MIT SCAN with the permission of the Engineer. If the position or alignment of the dowel bars at one of these joints does not comply with the requirements and if that joint remains the only one that does not comply after the next 3 consecutive joints of the same type have been inspected, then the method of placing dowels shall be deemed to be satisfactory. In order to check sufficient joints for dowel bar alignment without extending the trial length unduly joints may be constructed at more frequent joint intervals than the normal spacing required in trial slabs.\n\nb) If there are deficiencies in the first expansion joint that is constructed as a trial, the next expansion joint shall be a trial joint. Should this also be deficient, further trial of expansion joints shall be made as part of the trial length which shall not form part of the permanent works, unless agreed by the Engineer.\n\n# 602.11.5.3 Density\n\nIn-situ density in trial length shall be assessed as described in Clause 903.5.2.2 from at least 3 cores drilled from each part of the trial length when the concrete is not less than 7 days old. Should any of the cores show honey-combing in the concrete, the trial length shall be rejected and the construction in the main carriageway shall not be permitted until further trials have shown that modification has been made which would result in adequate compaction.\n\n# 602.11.5.4 Strength\n\nMinimum of thirty (30) beams for flexural strength and thirty (30) cubes for compressive strength shall be prepared from the concrete delivered in front of the paving plant. Each pair of beams and cubes shall be from the same location/batch but different sets of beams and cubes shall be from different locations/batches. Compressive and flexural strength shall be tested after 28 days water curing in the laboratory.\n\n291\n\nSection 600\n# Concrete Pavement\n\nAt the age of 28 days, thirty (30) cores with diameter 150 mm shall be cut from the pavement slab when the thickness of concrete pavement is more than 300 mm. In case the concrete pavement thickness is less than 300 mm, the dia of core shall be 100 mm. The cores shall be suitably cut at both ends to provide a specimen of plain surface on both ends. The dia to height ratio of core shall be 1 to 2. For cylindrical specimen of PQC of dia 150 mm, the variation in dia shall be \u00b1 0.5 mm, a tolerance on height shall be \u00b1 1 mm for a specimen of height 300 mm or more. For cylindrical specimen of dia 100 mm, the variation in dia shall be \u00b1 0.3 mm, and a tolerance on height shall be \u00b11 mm for a specimen height of 200 mm. The compressive strength test shall be conducted as per IS:516.\n\nConcrete in the member represented by a core test shall be considered acceptable, if the average equivalent cube strength of the cores is equal to at least 85 percent of the cube strength (characteristic strength) of the grade of the concrete specified for the corresponding age of 28 days and no individual core has a strength less than 75 percent.\n\n# 202.11.6 Approval and Acceptance\n\n# 602.11.6.1\n\nApproval of the materials, plant, equipment and construction methods shall be given when the trial length complies with the Specifications. The Contractor shall not proceed with normal working until the trial length has been approved. If the Engineer does not notify the Contractor of any deficiencies in any trial length within 7 days after the completion of that trial length, the Contractor may assume that the trial length, and the materials, plant, equipment and construction methods adopted are acceptable, provided that the 28 days strength of cubes and cores extracted from trial length meet the requirement of the Specified strength.\n\n# 602.11.6.2\n\nWhen approval has been given, the materials, plant, equipment and construction methods shall not thereafter be changed, except for normal adjustments and maintenance of plant, without the approval of the Engineer. Any changes in materials, plant, equipment, and construction methods shall entitle the Engineer to require the Contractor to lay a further trial length as described in this Clause to demonstrate that the changes will not adversely affect the permanent works.\n\n# 602.11.6.3\n\nTrial lengths which do not comply with the Specifications, with the exception of areas which are deficient only in surface texture and which can be remedied in accordance with Clause 602.9.11.6 shall be removed immediately upon notification of deficiencies by the Engineer and the Contractor shall construct a further trial length.\n\n# 602.11.7 Inspection of Dowel Bars\n\n# 602.11.7.1\n\nCompliance with Clause 602.6.5. for the position and alignment of dowel bars at contraction and expansion joints shall be checked by measurements relative to the side forms or guide wires.\n\n# 602.11.7.2\n\nWhen the slab has been constructed, the position and alignment of dowel bars and any filler board shall be measured after carefully exposing them in the plastic.\n\n292\n\nConcrete Pavement                                                              Section 600\n\nconcrete across the whole width of the slab. When the joint is an expansion joint, the top of the filler board shall be exposed sufficiently in the plastic concrete to permit measurement of any lateral or vertical displacement of the board. During the course of normal working, these measurements shall be carried out in the pavement section at the end of days work by extending slab length by 2 m. After sawing the transverse joint groove, the extended 2 m slab shall be removed carefully soon after concrete has set to expose dowels over half the length. These dowels can be tested for tolerances. This joint shall be treated as construction joint. The position of dowel bars in any type of transverse joint ie, contraction, construction or expansion can alternatively be tested by suitable device like MIT SCAN with the permission of the Engineer.\n\n# 602.11.7.3\n\nIf the position and alignment of the bars in a single joint in the slab is unsatisfactory then the next two joints shall be inspected. If only one joint of the three is defective, the rate of checking shall be increased to one joint per day until the Engineer is satisfied that compliance is being achieved.\n\n# 602.11.7.4\n\nAfter the dowel bars have been examined, the remainder of the concrete shall be removed over a width of 500 mm on each side of the line of the joint and reinstated to the satisfaction of the Engineer. The dowels shall be inserted on both sides of the 1 m wide slab by drilling holes and grouting with epoxy mortar. Plastic sheath as per Clause 602.6.5.5 shall be provided on dowels on one of the joints. The joint groove shall be widened and sealed as per Clause 602.10.\n\n# 602.11.8\n\n# inspection of tie Bars\n\nTo check the position of the tie bars, one metre length 0.5 m on either side of the longitudinal joint shall be opened when the concrete is green (within 20 to 30 minutes of its laying). The pit shall be refilled with the fresh concrete of same mix after checking.\n\n# 602.12\n\n# Measurement of texture depth \u2013 sand patch Method\n\n# 602.12.1\n\nThe following Apparatus shall be used:\n\n- A cylindrical container of 25 ml internal capacity;\n- A flat wooden disc 64 mm diameter with a hard rubber disc, 1.5 mm thick, next to one face, the reverse face being provided with a handle;\n- Dry natural sand with a rounded particle shape passing a 300 micron IS sieve and retained on a 150 micron IS sieve.\n\n# 602.12.2\n\nMethod\n\nThe surface to be measured shall be dried, any extraneous mortar and loose material removed and the surface swept clean using a wire brush both at right angles and parallel to the carriageway. The cylindrical container shall be filled with the sand, tapping the base 3 times on the surface to ensure compaction, and striking off the sand level with the top of the cylinder. The sand shall be poured into a heap on the surface to be treated.\n\n293\n\nSection 600\n# Concrete Pavement\n\nbe spread over the surface, working the disc with its face kept flat in a circular motion so that the sand is spread into a circular patch with the surface depressions filled with sand to the level of peaks.\n\n# 602.12.3\n\nThe diameter of the patch shall be measured to the nearest 5 mm. The texture depth of concrete surface shall be calculated from 31000/(DxD) mm where D is the diameter of the patch in mm.\n\n# 602.12.4\n\n# Measurement of texture depth - tining\n\n# 602.12.4.1\n\nThe following apparatus shall be used :\n\n- i) Tire Tread Depth Gauge\nA stainless steel tire tread depth gauge with graduations with least count of 1.0 mm. The gauge end may be modified to measure depth of tine texture.\n- ii) A stainless steel caliper to measure spacing of tines. If necessary the caliper may be modified to measure the spacing and width of tine texture. The gauge shall be used after making necessary calibration.\n- iii) Wire brush\n- iv) Corborundum stone\n- v) Steel straight edge to remove snots etc. sticking to the surface. The straight edge may be of 6 x 25 x 300 mm size.\n\n# 602.12.4.2\n\ntest section\n\nA unit of testing shall be 75 m per lane. If the length of construction is less than 75 m it shall be taken as one unit.\n\n# 602.12.4.3\n\ntest procedure\n\nIn each 75 m section, along the diagonal line, 10 points shall be selected for making checks of depth, width and spacing of tine grooves. The surface where tests are to be conducted shall be cleared carefully with a wire brush or a steel straight edge or using a corborundum plate to remove any upward projection of concrete. When the base plate of the gauge is in contact with the concrete surface, the gauge shall be pressed to the bottom of groove and the depth shall be measured and recorded at this location. At the same location, the spacing of tines shall be measured to verify whether the pattern recommended in Clause 602.9.11.1 is complied or not.\n\nThe average of depth and width at 10 locations shall be calculated and recorded to the nearest 1 mm. The spacing of spectrum measured at 10 locations shall be recorded separately.\n\n# 602.12.5\n\nThe average depth shall be 3 to 4 mm. When the depth is less than 2.5 mm and in excess of 4.5 mm, the Contractor shall stop concreting till he corrects his tine.\n\n294\n\nConcrete Pavement\n# Section 600\n\nbrush or replaces it. The sensors associated with work shall be again calibrated to achieve the required texture. The textured groove less than 2.5 mm shall be re-grooved using concrete saw at the cost of Contractor. Variation in texture width in the range of 3+1 mm and 3 - 0.5 mm will be acceptable. If the variation of width is in excess of this range, the Contractor shall stop work and correct the brush and technique. When the spacing of spectrum is not satisfactory, the Contractor shall replace the entire brush.\n\n# 602.13 Opening to Traffic\n\nNo vehicular traffic shall be allowed to ply on the finished surface of a concrete pavement within a period of 28 days of its construction and until the joints are permanently sealed and cured. The road may be opened to regular traffic after completion of the curing period of 28 days and after sealing of joints is completed including the construction of shoulder, with the written permission of the Engineer.\n\n# 602.14 acceptance criteria in Quality and distress\n\ni) tolerances for surface regularity, level, thickness and strength:\n\nThe tolerances for surface regularity, level, thickness and strength shall conform to the requirements given in Clause 903.5. Control of quality of materials and works shall be exercised by the Engineer in accordance with Section 900.\n\nii) tolerances in distress: The acceptance criteria with regard to the types of distresses in rigid pavement shall be as per IRC:SP-83. \u201cGuidelines for Maintenance, Repair and Rehabilitation of Cement Concrete Pavements\u201d.

It includes geotextiles, geogrids, geostrips, geomembranes, geonets, geocomposites, geocells, geosynthetic mats, paving fabric and glass grid etc. Geo fabrics made from natural fibres such as jute, and coir referred to herein under natural geotextiles may also be used in different geotechnical engineering applications.\n\n# i) geotextiles\n\nAny permeable synthetic textile used with foundation, soil, rock, earth, or any other geotechnical engineering-related material as an integral part of a human-made project, structure, or system. The geotextile fabric shall be a woven, non-woven or knitted fabric consisting of long-chain polymeric filaments or yarns such as polypropylene, polyethylene or polyester or any combination thereof, formed into a stable network such that the filaments or yarns retain their relative position to each other.\n\nThere are several application areas for geotextiles requiring specific functions namely separation, filtration, drainage, reinforcement or a combination thereof.\n\n# ii) geogrids\n\nA deformed or non-deformed netlike polymeric material used with foundation, soil, rock, earth, or any other geotechnical engineering-related material as an integral part of human-made project, structure, or system. Geogrids have relatively high strength, high modulus, and low-creep-sensitive polymers with apertures varying from 10 to 100 mm in size or more. The openings/holes in geogrids are either elongated ellipse, near squares with rounded corners, squares or rectangles. Geogrids can be of uni-axial grid, bi-axial grid or three dimensional grids. Geostrip is another form of geogrid, which is used in reinforced soil structures. It is primarily made of synthetic material in strips and is made from high tenacity polyester yarn and contained in a suitable polymer sheath. These are used as reinforcement in pavements and reinforced soil slopes.\n\n# iii) geomembranes\n\nAn essentially impermeable membrane (liner or barrier) used with foundation, soil, rock, earth, or in any other geotechnical application as an integral part of human-made project, structure, or system, used to control fluid migration.\n\n299\n\n# Section 700\n\n# Geosynthetics\n\nGeomembranes are made from PVC or polyethylene sheets, which are duly protected from ultraviolet exposure by carbon black or any antioxidants and thermal stabilizers. These are used as capillary cut off in roads in water logged areas.\n\n# iv) Geonets\n\nGeonets are used in combination with other types of geosynthetics. These are usually formed by continuous polymeric ribs at acute angle to one another. When the ribs are opened relatively large size apertures are formed in a net like configuration. These are used in combination with other geosynthetic materials to form a composite material.\n\n# v) Geocomposite\n\nA manufactured material, which could be a combination of any two or more synthetic materials like geotextiles, geogrids, geonets and geomembranes etc., in laminated or composite form. One of the popular form of geocomposite is Drainage Composite. Drainage Composites are formed by combining geotextile or geomembrane with a core of geonet or seratted/corrugated polymeric materials. Prefabricated Vertical Drains (PVD)/Band Drains and Fin Drains come under the category of geocomposites.\n\n# vi) Geocell\n\nIt is a three dimensional structure with interconnected cells. The geocells are made of polyester/polypropylene/high density polyethylene stabilized with carbon black. Geocells may be used in erosion control of slopes.\n\n# vii) Geosynthetic Mats\n\nThese are two dimensional or three dimensional mats with specified thickness, made of multi-filaments, with apertures to allow vegetation growth for erosion control application. Geosynthetic mat consists of UV stabilized non-degradable polypropylene/polyethylene or similar polymer fibres that are extruded or heat bonded to provide a dimensionally stable matrix. A tension element like steel wire mesh or geogrid shall be included in these mats as reinforcement, where these mats are required to posses more strength against erosive forces, like in steep slopes or in heavy rainfall areas. These are used for erosion protection of slopes.\n\n# viii) Natural Geotextiles\n\nThese geotextiles are made of natural fibres like jute or coir. The blankets/mats/mesh made of these fibres are sometimes further reinforced with polymeric nettings to enhance its tensile strength and for holding the fibres intact. The polymer netting is securely stitched on both sides of the fabric to form a strong quilted mat. These fabrics have excellent drapability and aid in quick growth of vegetation and are used for erosion control applications.\n\nGeosynthetics\n# Section 700\n\nix) paving fabric and glass grids: The paving fabrics are non woven heat set material, consisting of at least 85% by weight of polyolefins, polyester or polyamides. They are heat bonded only on one side. Glass grids are either a composite glass fibre reinforced geogrid with continuous filament nonwoven geotextile chemically/mechanically bonded to the grid, or bituminous coated glass fibre geogrids with or without adhesive on one side of the grid. The paving fabric, glass grids and composite of fabric and glass grids are used in bituminous pavements to act as stress relieving membrane and crack retarding layer within the pavement structure. The paving fabric also serves the function of water barrier.\n\n# 701.2 Testing, Certification and Acceptance\n\n# 701.2.1 Geosynthetic Materials Shall be Tested and Certified in the Following Manner.\n\n- a) The manufacturer shall have ISO or CE certification for manufacturing process and quality control.\n- b) The manufacturer shall provide manufacturer\u2019s test certificate for every lot supplied from the factory.\n- c) The supplier shall provide third party test reports from an independent laboratory with valid accreditation for all the test values in Manufacturer\u2019s test certificate.\n\n# 701.2.2\n\nGeosynthetics shall be tested in accordance with tests prescribed by BIS. In absence of IS codes, tests prescribed either by ASTM, EN, BS or ISO shall be conducted.\n\n# 701.2.3\n\nThe material shall meet the requirements as specified in the contract.\n\n# 701.3 Marking\n\nGeosynthetic rolls shall be marked with the following information:\n\n- a) Manufacturer\u2019s name\n- b) Roll number\n- c) Grade\n- d) Length\n- e) Date of manufacture; and\n- f) Product identification details\n\n301\n\nSection 700 Geosynthetics\n\n# 701.4 Packing, Storage and Handling\n\n# 701.4.1\n\nEach geosynthetic roll shall be wrapped with a material that will protect the geosynthetic from damage due to shipment, water, sunlight and contaminants.

Potholes and locally failed and cracked pavement sections shall be repaired as directed by the Engineer. If the existing pavement is rough or has been milled, a levelling course shall be provided prior to installation of the Glass grid.\n\n# 708.3.3 tack coat\n\nThe tack coat used to impregnate the fabric and bond the fabric to the pavement shall be paving grade Bitumen of VG-10. Glass fiber grids with adhesive on one side may not require a tack coat.\n\nThe tack coat shall be applied using a calibrated distributor spray bar. Hand spraying, squeegee and brush application may be used only in locations where the distributor truck cannot reach. The tack coat shall be uniformly applied at a rate to bond the nonwoven scrim to the existing pavement surface. The tack coat application rate shall be 1 Kg per square metre or as specified in the contract. When using emulsions, the application rate must be increased as directed by the Engineer to take into account the water content in the emulsion.\n\nThe temperature of the tack coat shall be sufficiently high to permit a uniform spray. Bitumen shall be sprayed at temperatures between 143\u00b0C and 163\u00b0C. For emulsions, the distributor tank temperatures shall be maintained between 55\u00b0C and 71\u00b0C. The target width of the tack coat application shall be equal to the Glass grid width plus 100-150 mm. The tack coat shall be applied only as far in advance of Glass grid installation as is appropriate to ensure a tacky surface at the time of Glass grid placement. Traffic shall not be allowed on the tack coat. Excess tack coat shall be cleaned from the pavement.\n\n# 708.3.4 paving fabric placement\n\nThe paving fabric shall be placed onto the tack coat using mechanical or manual lay down equipment capable of providing a smooth installation with a minimum amount of wrinkling or folding. The paving fabric shall be placed before to the tack coat cools and loses tackiness. After laying the paving fabric, some loose bituminous premix material shall be sprinkled on it in the wheel path of the paver and the tipper to ensure that the fabric is not picked up between the wheels. Paving fabric shall not be installed in areas where the bituminous overlay tapers to a thickness of less than 40 mm. Excess paving fabric which extends beyond the edge of existing pavement or areas of tack coat application shall be trimmed and removed.\n\nWhen bitumen emulsions are used, the emulsion shall be allowed to cure properly such that no water/moisture remains prior to placing the paving fabric. Wrinkles or folds in excess of 25 mm shall be single-lapped in the direction of the paving operation. Brooming and/or pneumatic rolling will be required to maximize paving fabric contact with the pavement surface. Additional hand-placed tack coat may be required at laps and repairs as determined by the Engineer to satisfy bitumen retention of the lapped paving fabric. All areas where paving fabrics have been placed shall be paved the same day. No traffic except necessary construction equipment will be allowed to drive on the paving fabric. Turning of the paver and other vehicles shall be done gradually and kept to a minimum to avoid movement and\n\n320\n\nGeosynthetics\n# Section 700\n\nDamage to the paving fabric. Abrupt starts and stops shall also be avoided. Damaged fabric shall be removed and replaced with the same type of fabric. Overlaps shall be shingle-lapped in the direction of paving. Additional tack coat shall be placed between the overlap to satisfy saturation requirements of the fabric. Overlap shall be sufficient to ensure full closure of the joint but not exceed 150 mm. Transverse joints shall be overlapped in the direction of the pavement by 100 to 150 mm or as per the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations or as directed by the Engineer. Longitudinal joints shall be overlapped by 20-30 mm or as per the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations or as directed by the engineer. The overlay operations shall be completed at the earliest after laying the fabric.\n\n# 708.3.5 Glass Grid Placement\n\nThe glass grid shall be placed on the surface provided by the tack coat using mechanical or manual lay down equipment capable of providing a smooth installation with a minimum amount of wrinkling or folding. On curves, the Glass grid must be cut and realigned to match the curvature.\n\nGlass grid shall not be installed in areas where the bituminous overlay tapers to a compacted thickness of less than 40 mm. When emulsions are used, the emulsion shall be allowed to cure properly such that no water/moisture remains prior to placing the glass grid. Wrinkles severe enough to cause folds shall be slit and laid flat. Brooming and/or rubber-tire rolling will be required to maximize glass grid contact with the pavement surface. Additional hand-placed tack coat may be required at overlaps and repairs as required by the Engineer. Turning and braking of the paver and other vehicles shall be done gradually and kept to a minimum to avoid movement and damage to the glass grid. Damaged composite shall be removed and replaced with the same type of composite and a tack coat.\n\nAll areas where glass grid has been placed shall be paved the same day. No traffic except necessary construction traffic shall be allowed to drive on the glass grid. Overlaps shall be shingle-lapped in the direction of paving. Additional tack coat shall be placed between the overlap to satisfy saturation requirements of the fabric. Overlap shall be sufficient to ensure full closure of the joint but not exceeding 150 mm.\n\n# 708.3.6 Overlay Placement\n\nBituminous overlay construction shall closely follow the placement of paving fabric or glass-grid. Excess tack coat that bleeds through the paving fabric or glass grid shall be removed by broadcasting hot mix or sand on the glass grid. Excess sand or hot mix shall be removed before beginning the paving operation. In the event of rainfall prior to the placement of the asphalt overlay, the fabric must be allowed to dry completely before the overlay is placed. Overlay asphalt thickness shall meet the requirements of the contract drawings and documents. The minimum compacted thickness of the first lift of overlay asphalt concrete shall not be less than 40 mm.\n\n321\n\n\n\nSection 700 Geosynthetics\n\n# 708.4 Measurement\n\nThe paving fabric/ glass fibre geogrid shall be measured in Square metres of paved area covered by the fabric/ glass fibre geogrid.\n\n# 708.5 Rate\n\nThe contract unit rate shall be for the accepted quantities of paving fabric. The rate shall be full compensation for the work performed and furnishing, preparing, hauling and placing materials including all labour, material, freight, tools, equipment and incidentals to complete the work as per contract.\n\n322\n\n# 800\n\n# Traffic Signs, Markings and Other Road Appurtenances\n\nNO_CONTENT_HERE\n\nTraffic Signs, Markings and other Road Appurtenances\n# Section 800\n\n# 801 traffic signs\n\n# 801.1 scope\n\nThe work shall consist of the fabrication, supply and installation of ground mounted traffic signs on roads.

If high areas in excess 6 mm or low areas in excess of 3 mm occur, exceeding the permitted numbers and if the Contractor cannot rectify, the slab shall be demolished and reconstructed at the Contractor\u2019s expense and in no case the area removed shall be less than the full width of the lane in which the irregularity occurs and full length of the slab.\n\nIf deemed necessary by the Engineer, any section of the slab which deviates from the specified levels and tolerances shall be demolished and reconstructed at the Contractor\u2019s cost.\n\n# 902.6 Riding Quality\n\nThe riding quality of bituminous concrete wearing surface, as measured by a standard towed fifth wheel bump integrator, shall not be more than 2000 mm per Km.\n\n# 903 Quality control tests during construction\n\n# 903.1 General\n\nThe materials supplied and the works carried out by the Contractor shall conform to the specifications prescribed in the Clauses for the relevant items of work.\n\nFor ensuring the requisite quality of construction, the materials and works shall be subjected to quality control tests, as described hereinafter. The testing frequencies set forth are the desirable minimum and the Engineer shall have the full authority to carry out additional tests as frequently as he may deem necessary, to satisfy himself that the materials and works comply with the appropriate specifications. However, the number of tests recommended in Tables 900-3 and 900-4 may be reduced at the discretion of the Engineer if it is felt that consistency in the quality of materials can still be maintained with the reduced number of tests.\n\nTest procedures for the various quality control tests are indicated in the respective Sections of these Specifications or for certain tests within this Section. Where no specific testing procedure is mentioned, the tests shall be carried out as per the prevalent accepted engineering practice to the directions of the Engineer.\n\n421\n\nSection 900

The determination of density shall be in accordance with IS: 2720 (Part-28). Test locations shall be chosen only through random sampling techniques. If non-destructive tests are carried out, the number of tests shall be doubled. If considerable variations are observed between individual density results, the minimum number of tests in one set of measurement shall be increased.

The measurements shall be taken at centre line of each lane for a minimum completed length of one Km.\n\n# 903.5 Quality control tests for concrete road construction\n\n# 903.5.1 dry lean concrete sub-base\n\n# 903.5.1.1 sampling and testing of cubes\n\nSamples of dry lean concrete for making cubes shall be taken from the uncompacted material from different locations immediately before compaction at the rate of 3 samples for each 1000 sq.m or part thereof laid each day. The sampling of mix shall be done from the paving site.\n\n429\n\nSection 900 Quality Control for Road Works\n\nTest cubes of 150 mm size shall be made immediately from each mix sample. Cubes shall be made in accordance with the methods described in IS:516 except that the cubes shall be compacted by means of a vibratory hammer with the moulds placed on a level and rigid base. The vibrating hammer shall be electric or pneumatic type fitted with a square or rectangular foot having an area of between 7500 to 14000 sq.mm. The compaction shall be uniformly applied for 60\u00b1 5 seconds with a downward force of between 300 N and 400 N on to each of the three layers of the lean concrete material placed into the mould. The surface of each compacted layer shall be scarified before the next layer is added to give key for the next layer. The final layer shall be finished flush with the top of the cube mould. The dry lean concrete shall be cured in accordance with IS:516.\n\n# 903.5.1.2 in-situ density\n\nThe dry density of the laid material shall be determined from three density holes at locations equally spaced along a diagonal that bisects each 2000 sq.m or part thereof laid each day and shall comply with the requirements as per Clause 601.6.5.1. This rate of testing may be increased at the discretion of the Engineer in case of doubt or to determine the extent of defective area in the event of non-compliance. Density holes at random may be made to check the density at edges.\n\n# 903.5.1.3 thickness\n\nThe average thickness of the subbase layer as computed by the level data of sub-base and subgrade or lower sub-base shall be as per the thickness specified in the contract drawings. The thickness at any single location shall not be 8 mm less than the specified thickness. Such areas shall be corrected as stated in Clause 601.6.5.5. Areas which cannot be repaired should be replaced over full width. The extent of deficient area should be decided based on cores.\n\n# 903.5.1.4 frequency of Quality control tests\n\nThe frequency of quality control tests for levels, alignment and materials shall be as given in Table 900-6.\n\n# 903.5.2 pavement concrete\n\n# 903.5.2.1 sampling and testing of Beam and cube specimens\n\nAt least three beams and three cube specimens, one set of three each for 7 day and 28 day strength tests shall be cast for every 150 cu.m (or part thereof) of concrete placed during construction. On each day\u2019s work, not less than three pairs of beams and cubes.\n\n\n\nQuality Control for Road Works                                                      Section 900\nshall be made for each type of mix from the concrete delivered to the paving plant. Each pair shall be from a different delivery of concrete and tested at a place to be designated by the Engineer in accordance with the testing procedure as outlined in Clause 602.3.3. Groups of four consecutive results from single specimens tested at 28 days shall be used for assessing the strength for compliance with the strength requirements. The specimens shall be transported in an approved manner to prevent sudden impact causing fractures or damage to the specimen. The flexural strength test results shall prevail over compressive strength tests for compliance.\n\n# 903.5.2.2\n\nA quality control chart indicating the strength values of individual specimens shall be maintained for continuous quality assurance. Where the requirements are not met with, or where the quality of the concrete or its compaction is suspect, the actual strength of the concrete in the slab shall be ascertained by carrying out tests on cores cut at the rate of 2 cores for every 150 cu.m of concrete. The average of the results of crushing strength tests on these cores shall not be less than 0.8 x 0.85 times the corresponding characteristic compressive strength of cubes, where the height to diameter ratio of the cores is two. Where height to diameter ratio is not two, necessary corrections shall be made in calculating the crushing strength of cubes in the following manner.\n\nThe crushing strengths of cylinders with height to diameter ratios between 1 and 2 may be corrected to correspond to a standard cylinder of height to diameter ratio of 2 by multiplying with the correction factor obtained from the following equation:\n\nf = 0.11 n + 0.78\n\nwhere f = correction factor and n = height to diameter ratio\n\nThe corrected test results shall be analysed for conformity with the specification requirements for cube samples. Where the core tests are satisfactory, they shall have precedence for assessing concrete quality over the results of moulded specimens. The diameter of cores shall not be less than 150 mm.\n\nIf, however, the tests on cores also confirm that the concrete is not satisfying the strength requirements, then the concrete corresponding to the area from which the cores were cut should be replaced, i.e., at least over an area extending between two transverse joints where the defects could be isolated or over larger area, if necessary, as assessed by additional cores and their test results. The equivalent flexural strength at 28 days shall be estimated in accordance with Clause 602.3.3.2.\n\nIn order to ensure that the specified minimum strength at 28 days is attained in 1 in 20 of all test beams, the mix shall be proportioned to give an average strength at 28 days exceeding the specified strength by 1.65 times the standard deviation calculated first from the flexural strengths of test beams made from the trial mix and subsequently from the accumulating result of flexural strengths of job control test beams.\n\n431\n\nSection 900 Quality Control for Road Works\n\nThe standard deviation shall be re-calculated from the test results obtained after any change in the source or quality of materials and the mix shall be adjusted as necessary to comply with the requirements.\n\nAn individual 28 day test strength below the specified strength shall not be evidence for condemnation of the concrete concerned if the average 28 day strength of this beam plus the preceding 5 and succeeding 4 beams exceeds the specified strength by 1.65 times the standard deviation and provided that there is no other evidence that the concrete mix concerned is substandard.\n\nBeams shall be made each day in pairs at intervals, each pair being from a different batch of concrete. At the start of the work, and until such time as the Engineer may order a reduction in the number of beams required, at least six pairs of beams and cubes shall be made each day, one of each pair for testing at 28 days for determination of minimum permissible flexural strength and the other for testing at an early age for the Engineer to assess the quality of the mix. When the first thirty number of 28-day results are available, and for so long as the Engineer is satisfied with the quality of the mix, he may reduce the number of beams and cubes required.\n\nDuring the course of construction, when the source of any material is to be changed, or if there is any variation in the quality of the materials furnished, additional tests and necessary adjustments in the mix shall be made as required to obtain the specified strength.\n\nThe flexural strengths obtained on beams tested before 28 days shall be used in conjunction with a correlation between them and the 28 day flexural strengths to detect any deterioration in the quality of the concrete being produced. Any such deterioration shall be remedied without awaiting the 28 day strengths but the earlier strengths shall not constitute sole evidence of non-compliance of the concrete from which they were taken.\n\nConcrete shall be deemed not to comply with the Specification when more than one test beam in a batch has a 28 day strength less than the specified strength and the average 28 day flexural strength of the batch of beams is less than the specified strength plus 1.65 times the standard deviation of the batch.\n\nShould the concrete fail to comply with the Specification for strength as described above, the Contractor may, all at his own expense, elect to cut cores from the suspect concrete as the Engineer shall direct. From the relation between cube strength and flexural strength, the core strength shall be converted to flexural strength.\n\nThe equivalent flexural strength at 28 days shall be the estimated in-situ strength multiplied by 100 and divided by the age-strength relation obtained from Table 900-5.\n\nAny concrete that fails to meet the strength specification shall be removed and replaced at Contractor\u2019s expense.\n\n432\n\n# Quality Control for Road Works\n\n# Section 900\n\n# Table 900-5: Age-Strength Relation of Concrete (Related to 100 Percent at 28 Days)\n\n| Days | 0     | 2     | 4     | 6     | 8     |\n| ---- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |\n| 0    | \u2013     | 41.0  | 60.0  | 71.0  | 77.5  |\n| 10   | 81.5  | 85.0  | 87.5  | 90.0  | 92.0  |\n| 20   | 94.0  | 96.0  | 97.5  | 98.5  | 100.0 |\n| 30   | 101.0 | 102.0 | 103.5 | 104.5 | 105.5 |\n| 40   | 106.5 | 107.0 | 108.0 | 109.5 | 110.0 |\n| 50   | 110.5 | 111.0 | 112.0 | 112.5 | 113.0 |\n| 60   | 114.0 | 114.5 | 115.0 | 115.5 | 116.0 |\n| 70   | 116.5 | 117.0 | 117.5 | 118.0 | 118.5 |\n| 80   | 119.0 | 119.5 | 119.5 | 120.0 | 120.5 |\n| 90   | 121.0 | 121.5 | 122.0 | 122.0 | 122.5 |\n| 100  | 123.5 | 123.5 | 123.5 | 124.0 | 124.5 |\n| 110  | 125.0 | 125.0 | 125.5 | 125.5 | 126.0 |\n| 120  | 126.0 | 126.0 | 127.0 | 127.0 | 127.5 |\n| 130  | 127.5 | 128.0 | 128.5 | 128.5 | 129.0 |\n| 140  | 129.0 | 129.5 | 129.5 | 130.0 | 130.0 |\n| 150  | 130.5 | 130.5 | 131.0 | 131.0 | 131.5 |\n| 160  | 131.5 | 131.5 | 132.0 | 132.0 | 132.5 |\n| 170  | 132.5 | 132.5 | 133.0 | 133.0 | 133.5 |\n| 180  | 133.5 | 134.0 | 134.0 | 134.5 | 134.5 |\n| 190  | 135.0 | 135.0 | 135.0 | 135.5 | 135.5 |\n| 200  | 135.5 | 135.5 | 136.0 | 136.0 | 136.5 |\n| 210  | 136.5 | 136.5 | 137.0 | 137.0 | 137.0 |\n| 220  | 137.0 | 137.5 | 137.5 | 137.5 | 138.0 |\n| 230  | 138.0 | 138.5 | 138.5 | 138.5 | 138.5 |\n| 240  | 139.0 | 139.0 | 139.0 | 139.5 | 139.5 |\n| 250  | 139.5 | 140.0 | 140.0 | 140.0 | 140.0 |\n| 260  | 140.5 | 140.5 | 140.5 | 140.5 | 141.0 |\n| 270  | 141.0 | 141.0 | 141.5 | 141.5 | 141.5 |\n| 280  | 142.0 | 142.0 | 142.0 | 142.0 | 142.0 |\n| 290  | 142.5 | 142.5 | 142.5 | 142.5 | 142.5 |\n| 300  | 143.0 | 143.0 | 143.0 | 143.0 | 143.5 |\n\n\nSection 900 Quality Control for Road Works\n\n| days | 0     | 2     | 4     | 6     | 8     |\n| ---- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |\n| 310  | 143.5 | 143.5 | 144.0 | 144.0 | 144.0 |\n| 320  | 144.0 | 144.5 | 144.5 | 144.5 | 144.5 |\n| 330  | 144.5 | 145.0 | 145.0 | 145.0 | 145.0 |\n| 340  | 145.0 | 145.5 | 145.5 | 145.5 | 145.5 |\n| 350  | 146.0 | 146.0 | 146.0 | 146.0 | 146.0 |\n| 360  | 146.0 | 146.0 | 146.5 | 146.5 | 146.5 |\n\n# 903.5.2.3 in-situ density\n\nThe density of the compacted concrete shall be such that the total air voids are not more than 3 percent. The air voids shall be derived from the difference between the theoretical maximum dry density of the concrete calculated from the specific gravity of the constituents of the concrete mix and the average value of three direct density measurements made on cores at least 150 mm diameter. Three cores shall be taken from trial lengths and in first two km length of the pavement, while the slab is being constructed during normal working. The proportions of the mix and the vibratory effort imparted i.e. the frequency and magnitude of vibration shall be adjusted to achieve the maximum density.\n\nAll cores taken for density measurement in the trial section shall also be checked for thickness. The same cores shall be made use of for determining in-situ strength. In case of doubt, additional cores may be ordered by the Engineer and taken at locations decided by him to check the density of concrete slab or the position of dowel/tie bars without any compensation being paid for the same.\n\nIn calculation of the density, allowance shall be made for any steel in cores. Cores removed from the main carriageway shall be reinstated with compacted concrete with mix proportions of 1 part of Portland cement : 2 parts of fine aggregate:2 parts of 10 mm nominal size single sized coarse aggregate by weight. Before filling the fine mix, the sides shall be hacked and cleaned with water. Thereafter cement-sand slurry shall be applied to the sides just prior to filling the concrete mix.\n\n# 903.5.2.4 thickness\n\nThickness shall be controlled by taking levels as indicated in Clause 902.3. Thickness of the slab at any point checked as mentioned above shall be within a tolerance of -5 mm to + 10 mm of the specified thickness as per Drawing. Thickness deficiency more than 5 mm may be accepted and paid for at a reduced rate given in Clause 602.16.3.

The air inside the store shall be kept dry as far as possible by using various means to the satisfaction of the Engineer, so as to eliminate the possibility of initial rusting of prestressing steel during storage. Instrument measuring the air humidity shall be installed inside the store. The prestressing steel shall be coated with water-soluble grease.\n\nAll prestressing steel shall be stored at least 300 mm above ground level and shall be invariably wrapped with a protective covering of tar paper or polythene or any other approved material. The Contractor should ensure that prestressing steel is used within 3 months of its manufacture. He should chalk out his prestressing programme in such a manner as to avoid the possibility of initial corrosion before placing in position.\n\n# 1014.7 water\n\nWater shall be stored in containers/tanks covered at top and cleaned at regular intervals in order to prevent intrusion of foreign matter or growth of organic matter. Use of water from shallow, muddy or marshy sources, shall not be permitted. The intake pipe shall be suitably enclosed to exclude silt, mud, grass and other solid materials and there shall be a minimum depth of 0.60 m of water below the intake at all times.\n\n# 1015 tests and standard of acceptance\n\nAll materials, even though stored in an approved manner shall be subjected to an acceptance test in accordance with the relevant IS specification prior to their immediate use. Independent testing of cement for every consignment shall be done by the Contractor at site or in the laboratory approved by the Engineer before use. Any cement with lower quality than that shown in manufacturer\u2019s certificate shall be debarred from use. In case of imported cement, the same series of tests shall be carried out before acceptance.\n\n# 1015.1 testing and approval of Material\n\nThe Contractor shall furnish test certificates from the manufacturer/supplier of materials along with each batch of material(s) delivered to site.\n\n453\n\nSection 1000 Materials For Structures\n\nThe Contractor shall set up a field laboratory with necessary equipment for testing of all materials, finished products used in the construction as per requirements of conditions of contract and the relevant specifications. The testing of all the materials shall be carried out by the Engineer for which the shall make all the necessary arrangements and bear the entire cost.\n\nTest which cannot be carried out in the field laboratory have to be got done at the Contractor\u2019s cost at any recognized laboratory/testing establishments approved by the Engineer.\n\n# 1015.2 Sampling of Materials\n\nSamples provided to the Engineer for inspection are to be in labelled boxes suitable for storage.\n\nSamples required for testing and approval must be supplied well in advance by at least 48 hours or before the minimum period required for carrying out the relevant tests. Delay to works arising from the late submission of samples, will not be acceptable as a reason for delay in completion of the works.\n\nIf materials are brought from abroad, the cost of sampling/testing whether in India or abroad shall be borne by the Contractor.\n\n# 1015.3 Rejection of Materials not Conforming to the Specifications\n\nAny stack or batch of material(s) of which sample(s) does (do) not conform to the prescribed tests and quality shall be rejected by the Engineer and such materials shall be removed from site by the Contractor at his own cost. Such rejected materials shall not be made acceptable by any rectifications.\n\n# 1015.4 Testing and Approval of Plant and Equipment\n\nAll plants and equipment used for preparing, testing and production of materials for incorporation into the permanent works, shall be in accordance with manufacturer\u2019s specifications and shall be got approved by the Engineer before use.\n\n454\n\n# Pile Foundations\n\nNO_CONTENT_HERE\n\nPile Foundations\n# Section 1100\n\n# 1101 Description\n\n# 1101.1\n\nThis work shall consist of construction of all types of piles for structures in accordance with the details shown on the drawings and conforming to the requirements of these Specifications or as directed by the Engineer.\n\n# 1101.2\n\nThe construction of pile foundations requires a careful choice of the piling system depending on subsoil conditions and loading characteristics and type of structure. The permissible limits of total and differential settlements, unsupported length of pile under scour, impact/entanglement of floating bodies and any other special requirements of project, are also equally important criteria for selection of the piling system. The method of installing the piles, including details of the equipment shall be submitted by the Contractor and got approved from the Engineer before commencement of work.\n\n# 1101.3\n\nThe work shall be carried out as per IS:2911 except as modified herein.\n\n# 1102 Subsurface Investigations\n\n# 1102.1\n\nThe complete subsurface investigations of strata in which pile foundations are proposed shall be carried out in advance along with in-situ pile tests. For details of geo-technical subsurface explorations, refer Section 2400 of these Specifications. Borings should be carried up to sufficient depths so as to ascertain the nature of strata around the pile shaft and below the pile tip. Depth of boring shall not be less than:\n\n- i) 1.5 times estimated length of pile in soil or 15 m below the proposed founding level\n- ii) 15 times diameter of pile in ordinary / jointed rock but minimum 15 m in such rock\n- iii) 4 times diameter of pile in hard rock but minimum 3 m in such rock\n\n# 1102.2\n\nThe subsurface investigations shall adequately define stratification of substrata including the nature and type of strata, their variation, extent and specific properties. The investigations shall be adequate for the purpose of selection of appropriate piling system and for estimating design capacities for different diameters and length of piles.\n\n# 1102.3\n\nPressure meter tests may be used in the case of rock, ground or soil for direct evaluation of strength and compressibility characteristics. Though these tests are of specialized nature, they are more appropriate for difficult/uncertain substrata and especially for important projects.\n\n# 1102.4\n\nFor piles socketed into rock, it is necessary to determine the uni-axial compressive strength of the rock and its quality.\n\n457\n\n\n# Section 1100 Pile Foundations\n\nThe investigations shall also include location of ground water table and other parameters including results of chemical tests showing sulphate and chloride content and any other deleterious chemical content in soil and/or ground water, likely to affect durability.\n\n# 1103 Type of Piles\n\n# 1103.1\n\nPiles may be of reinforced concrete, prestressed concrete, steel or timber and circular, square, hexagonal, octagonal, \u201cH\u201d or \u201cI\u201d Section in shape. They may be of solid or hollow sections or steel cases filled with concrete. Timber piles may be used for temporary bridges. Cast in-situ concrete piles may be driven cast in-situ or bored cast in-situ. Similarly, precast concrete piles also may be driven precast or bored precast. In bored precast piles, precast piles are lowered into pre-formed bores and annular space grouted.\n\n# 1103.2\n\nMinimum diameter of concrete pile shall be 1 m for river/marine bridges. For bridges beyond the water zone and bridges on land, the minimum diameter may be 750 mm.\n\n# 1104 Materials\n\n# 1104.1\n\nThe basic materials shall conform to Section 1000 of these Specifications. The specifications for steel reinforcement, structural concrete, prestressed concrete and structural steel to be used in pile foundations shall conform to Sections 1600, 1700, 1800 and 1900 respectively of these Specifications.\n\n# 1104.2 Concrete in Piles\n\nFor both precast and cast in in-situ piles, the grade of concrete, minimum cement content, water cement ratio and slump at the time of placement shall be as per Table 1100-1:\n\n|                            | Cast in-situ Concrete by tremie | Precast Concrete       |                                                 |         |         |\n| -------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------- | ------- |\n| Grade of concrete          | M 35                            | Minimum cement content | 400 kg/m\u00b3                                       |         |         |\n| Minimum water cement ratio | 0.4                             | 0.40                   | Slump (mm) as measured at the time of placement | 150-200 | 50 - 75 |\n\nThe terms \u2018minimum cement content\u2019 and \u2018minimum water cement\u2019 ratio mentioned in Table 1100-1, are to be based on total cementitious material (inclusive of all mineral admixtures called additives) mentioned in Clause 1007 of these Specifications. Maximum limits for such additives shall be as specified in Clause 1716.2 of these Specifications.\n\n\n\nPile Foundations\n# Section 1100\n\nHigh alumina cements (i.e. quick setting cement) shall not be used in marine conditions. When both chlorides and sulphates are present, in soil or ground water, sulphate resistant cement shall not be used. For improving resistance against the penetration of chlorides and sulphates from surrounding soils or water, mineral admixtures such as fly ash, silica fumes, GGBS conforming to respective BIS/International Standards and as per IRC:112, may be used.\n\n# 1105 Test Piles\n\n# 1105.1\n\nTest piles which are shown on the drawings or specified in the contract or installed by the Contractor on his own to determine the lengths of piles to be furnished, shall conform to the requirements for piling as indicated in these Specifications. Test piles which are used to arrive at the load carrying capacity shall not be incorporated in the structure. All test piles shall be installed with the same type of equipment that is proposed to be used for piling in the actual structure.\n\nTest piles which are not to be incorporated in the completed structure shall be removed to at least 600 mm below the proposed soffit level of pile cap and the remaining hole so formed shall be backfilled with earth or other suitable material. The piles shall be load tested in accordance with provisions laid down in this Section.\n\n# 1106 Precast Concrete Piles\n\n# 1106.1 General\n\nPrecast concrete piles shall be of the size and shape as shown in the approved drawings. If a square section is employed, the corners shall be chamfered by at least 25 mm unless otherwise specified on the drawings. The length of pile shall not normally exceed 25 m. However, where special equipments for handling and installation are available to the satisfaction of the Engineer, longer length could be permitted.\n\n# 1106.2 Stacking, Storing and Handling\n\nCare shall be taken that at all stages of transporting, lifting and handling, the piles are not damaged or cracked. During transport and stacking of piles, they shall be supported at the same points as those provided for lifting purposes. If the piles are put down temporarily during handling, they shall be placed on trestles or blocks located at the same points.\n\nPiles shall be stored at least 300 mm above firm level ground, which is not liable to unequal subsidence or settlement under the weight of the stack of piles. They shall be placed on timber supports which are level and spaced so as to avoid bending. The supports in different layers shall be vertically one above the other. Spaces shall be left round the piles to enable\n\n459\n\nSection 1100 Pile Foundations\n\nthem to be lifted without difficulty. The order of stacking shall be such that the older piles can be withdrawn without disturbing newer piles. Separate stacks shall be provided for different lengths of piles. Where piles are stacked in layers, the number of layers shall not exceed three. Whenever curing is needed during storage, arrangements shall be made to enable the piles to be watered. For detailed precautions with regard to curing operations for structural concrete, refer Section 1700 of these Specifications.\n\nBefore the operation of handling and driving the piles, the minimum periods counted from the time of casting shall be as indicated in Table 1100-2. Prestressed pile shall not be lifted or handled until fully stressed.\n\n| Type of Cement used in Casting the Pile | Minimum Periods from time of Casting |              |    |    |\n| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------ | -- | -- |\n| Strike side-end of Wet Curing (days)    | Lift from Bed (days)                 | Drive (days) |    |    |\n| Ordinary Portland                       | 24                                   | 7            | 10 | 28 |\n| Rapid hardening Portland                | 12                                   | 7            | 7  | 10 |\n\n# 1106.3 Lengthening of Piles\n\nWhere a pile is to have additional length cast on it during driving, the longitudinal reinforcement shall preferably be joined by full penetration butt welding. The concrete at the top of the original pile shall be cut down to expose not less than 200 mm of the bars to avoid spalling of the concrete by heat of welding. The added bars have to be held accurately and rigidly in position during welding. Where facilities on site are insufficient to make proper butt welding practicable, the joint may be made by lapping. The reinforcement at the head of pile will need to be exposed for full anchorage length or 600 mm whichever is greater and the new bars over-lapped for this distance. Unless otherwise specified, the extension of the pile shall be formed to the same cross-sectional profile and with concrete of at least the same strength as that specified for the original pile. The stirrup spacing shall in no case be greater than 150 mm. Not more than one extension shall be permitted. In case more than one extension is permitted by the Engineer, only approved mechanical couplers shall be used.\n\nDriving shall not be resumed until:\n\n- a) The strength of the concrete in the extension is at least equal to the specified characteristic strength of concrete in pile; and\n- b) The approval of the Engineer has been obtained.\n\n460\n\nPile Foundations\n# Section 1100\n\n# 1106.4 Removal of surplus length\n\nAny length of pile surplus to that required for incorporation in the structure shall be cut off neatly and removed. During the process of cutting off, it shall be ensured that projecting reinforcement to be anchored into the pile cap and the prestressing strands/wires are not damaged. When stripping prestressed concrete piles, sudden release of tendons shall be avoided. Reference may also be made to Clause 7.7.1 of IS:2911 (Part I, Section 3) in this connection.\n\n# 1106.5 Risen Piles\n\nLevel of top of each pile shall be taken after driving and again after all the piles are driven. Piles which are found to have risen due to ground heave or as a result of driving adjacent piles, shall be re-driven to the original depth or resistance unless re-driving tests on adjacent piles have shown this to be unnecessary.\n\n# 1106.6 Manufacture\n\nThe pile should be cast in one continuous operation from end to end of each pile. Manufacture of precast concrete piles shall conform to the guidelines contained in Clause 7.1, 7.2 and 7.3. or IS:2911 (Part I, Section 3).\n\nPiles shall be provided with suitable metal shoe for protecting the tip of the pile during driving in hard ground.\n\nPiles shall not be moved from casting bed until the concrete has hardened sufficiently.\n\nPiles shall not be driven in less than 28 days after casting or unless their strength at the time of driving is at least that specified for 28 days.\n\n# 1106.7 Prestressed Concrete Piles\n\nAdditional specifications for precast prestressed concrete piles shall conform to those contained in Clause 8 of IS:2911 (Part I, Section 3).\n\n# 1107 Cast in-situ Concrete Piles\n\n# 1107.1 General\n\nCast in-situ concrete piles may be either installed by drilling a bore into the ground and removing the material or by driving a metal casing with a shoe at the tip and displacing\n\n461\n\nSection 1100 Pile Foundations\n\nThe two types of piles are termed as \u201cbored piles\u201d and \u201cdriven piles\u201d respectively. Cast in-situ concrete piles may be cast in metal shells which may remain permanently in place. However, other types of reinforced concrete cast in-situ piles, cased or uncased, may be used if in the opinion of the Engineer the soil conditions permit their use and if their design and the methods of placing are satisfactory.\n\nCertain specific requirements regarding driving of cast in-situ driven piles shall be as per Clauses 1110 and 1111.\n\nAny liner or borehole which is improperly located or shows partial collapses that would affect the load carrying capacity of the pile, shall be rejected or repaired as directed by the Engineer at the cost of the Contractor.\n\nBoring shall be carried out using rotary equipment. Percussion type of equipment shall be used only if approved by the Engineer.\n\nThe diameter of the finished pile shall not be less than that specified. A continuous record shall be kept by the Engineer as to the volume of concrete placed in relation to the length of pile that is cast.\n\nDefective piles shall be removed or left in place as judged convenient without affecting the performance of adjacent piles or pile cap. Additional piles shall be provided to replace the defective piles.\n\n# 1107.2 Concreting\n\nWherever practicable, concrete should be placed in a clean dry hole. Prior to the placing of the reinforcement cage, the pile shaft shall be cleaned of all loose materials. Before concreting of the pile is commenced, it is essential to ensure that no debris remains at the bottom of the shaft, as inadequate cleaning of the base can lead to formation of a soft base or soft toe which may result in reduction of load bearing capacity of the pile.\n\nReinforcement for the pile as shown on the drawing shall be tied in place to form a cage which is lowered into the pile shaft. Suitable spacers shall be provided to maintain the required cover to reinforcing steel. Reinforcements at the bottom should not be provided with L-bends as these may interfere with cleaning of the pile base.\n\nWhere concrete is placed in dry and a casing is present, the top 3 m of the pile shall be compacted using internal vibrators.\n\nWhere the casing is withdrawn from cohesive soils for the formation of cast in-situ pile, the concreting should be done with necessary precautions to minimize the softening of the soil by excess water. Where mud flow conditions exist, the casing of cast in-situ piles shall not be allowed to be withdrawn.\n\n462\n\nPile Foundations\n# Section 1100\n\nCare shall be taken during concreting to prevent the segregation of the ingredients. The displacement or distortion of reinforcement during concreting and while extracting the casing, shall also be avoided.\n\nIf the concrete is placed inside precast concrete tubes or consists of precast sections, these shall be free from cracks or other damage before being installed.\n\nThe concrete shall be properly graded, shall be self-compacting and shall not get mixed with soil, excess water, or other extraneous matter. Special care shall be taken in silty clays and other soils which have the tendency to squeeze into the newly deposited concrete and cause necking. Sufficient head of green concrete shall be maintained to prevent inflow of soil or water into the concrete.\n\nThe placing of concrete shall be a continuous process from the toe level to the top of the pile. To ensure compaction by hydraulic static heads, rate of placing concrete in the pile shaft shall not be less than 6 m (length of pile) per hour.\n\n# 1107.3 Casing\n\nWhen concreting is carried out for a pile, a temporary casing should be installed to sufficient depth so as to ensure that fragments of soil from the sides of the hole do not drop into the concrete as it is placed. When the bore hole is stabilized using drilling mud, the temporary casing is not required except near the top.\n\nThe metal casing shall be of sufficient thickness and strength to hold its original form and show no harmful distortion while driving or when adjacent casings are driven.\n\nCast in-situ concrete driven piles shall be installed using a properly designed detachable shoe at the bottom of the casing.\n\nBored cast in-situ piles in soils which are stable, may often be installed with only a small casing length at the top. A minimum of 2 m length of top of bore shall invariably be provided with casing to ensure against loose soil falling into the bore. In cases in which the side soil can fall into the hole, it is necessary to stabilize the side of the bore hole with drilling mud, or a suitable steel casing. Permanent steel liner shall be provided at least up to maximum scour level. The minimum thickness of steel liner shall be 6 mm.\n\nPermanent steel liner shall be provided for the full depth of the pile in the following situations where:\n\n- i) The surrounding soil is marine clay\n- ii) Soft soil is present\n- iii) Surrounding soil has sulphate content equal to or more than 1%\n\n463\n\nSection 1100\n# Pile Foundations\n\niv) Surrounding water has sulphate content equal to or more than 2500 ppm\n\nv) Leakage of sewage is expected\n\nFor bored cast in-situ piles, casing/liner shall be driven open ended with a pile driving hammer capable of achieving penetration of the liner to the depth shown on the drawing or as approved by the Engineer. Materials inside the casing shall be removed progressively by air lift, grab or percussion equipment or other approved means.\n\nWhere bored cast in-situ piles are used in soils liable to flow, the bottom of the casing shall be kept sufficiently in advance of the boring tool to prevent the entry of soil into the casing, leading to formation of cavities and settlements in the adjoining ground. The water level in the casing should generally be maintained at the natural ground water level for the same reasons. The joints of the casing shall be made as leak-tight as possible to minimize inflow of water or leakage of slurry during concreting.\n\nThe diameter of the boreholes shall not be more than the inside diameter of the liner when the liners are installed before boring. When the liners are installed after boring, the diameter of the boreholes shall not be more than the outside diameter of liner + 2 mm, unless otherwise approved by Engineer.\n\n# 1107.4 use of tremie\n\nThe concrete should invariably be poured through a tremie with a funnel, so that the concrete can be properly deposited in the hole without segregation. For concreting done by tremie, the following requirements which are particularly applicable shall be ensured:\n\n- a) The hopper and tremie should be a leak proof system.\n- b) Diameter of tremie shall be not less than 200 mm for use with 20 mm diameter down aggregate.\n- c) The first charge of concrete should be placed with a sliding plug pushed down the tube ahead of it or with a steel plate with adequate charge to prevent mixing of concrete and water. However, the plug should not be left in the concrete as a lump.\n- d) The tremie pipe should always penetrate well into the concrete with an adequate margin of safety against accidental withdrawal of the pipe. The tremie should be always full of concrete.\n- e) The pile should be concreted wholly by tremie and the method of deposition should not be changed part way up the pile, to prevent laitance from being entrapped within the pile.\n- f) All tremie tubes shall be thoroughly cleaned after use.\n\n464\n\nPile Foundations\n# Section 1100\n\ng) For concrete placed through tremie, there is no need to add 10 percent extra cement.\n\nh) Concreting of piles shall be carried out continuously. In exceptional cases of interruption of concreting the tremie shall not be taken out of the concrete under any circumstances. The tremie pipe shall be raised and lowered slowly from time to time to prevent it from getting stuck in the concrete while ensuring its lower and does not come out of concrete. The concreting shall be resumed before final setting time of concrete, which shall be established before the start of the piling operation. For achieving longer setting time of the concrete, super plasticizers having retarding properties/retarders can be used. If any of these requirements are not met, the pile shall be rejected.\n\n# 1107.5 Removal of Concrete above Cut-off level\n\nIt is desirable that the concrete above cut-off level, is removed before the concrete is set. This may be done manually or by specially made bailer or other device. Such removal of concrete helps in preventing the damage of the good concrete below the cut-off level, which results from chipping by percussion method.\n\nThe removal of concrete shall be within \u00b1 25 mm from the specified cut off level, preferably on the minus side. After removal of such concrete, the concrete shall be compacted with rammer with spikes or vibrated.\n\nIn case the concrete is not removed before setting, a groove shall be made on outer perimeter by rotary equipment before chipping by percussion method.\n\nThe minimum embedment of cast in-situ concrete piles into pile cap shall not be less than 50 mm. Any defective concrete at the head of the completed pile shall be cut away and made good with new concrete. The clear cover between the bottom reinforcement in pile cap from the top of the pile shall be not less than 25 mm. The reinforcement in the pile shall be exposed for full anchorage length to permit it to be adequately bonded into the pile cap. Exposing such length shall be done carefully to avoid damaging the rest of the pile.\n\n# 1108 Steel Piles\n\nSteel piles shall be of \u201cH\u201d or \u201cI\u201d sections as shown on the drawings and shall be of structural steel conforming to Section 1000 of these Specifications.\n\nSteel piles shall be protected by suitable anti-corrosive painting as specified on the drawing or as directed by the Engineer. Piles shall be stored above the ground having protective packing to minimize damage to surface coating. Each pile shall be supplied preferably in one piece without splices.\n\n465\n\nSection 1100\n# Pile Foundations\n\nAt the option of the Contractor, steel piles consisting of structural steel plates welded together may be substituted for the rolled sections specified, provided the depth, width and average thicknesses are at least equal to those of the rolled sections, the steel plates conform to section 1000 of these Specifications. The flanges shall be welded to the web with continuous fillet welds on either side of the web, and the welding shall conform to Clause 1904.8 of these Specifications.\n\nThe length of the steel pile may be built up in sections either before or during driving operations. The sections shall be of identical cross-section. Pile splices shall be made with full penetration butt welds over the whole cross-section. Pile splices shall develop at least the yield strength of pile.\n\nThe connections shall be made by butt welding the entire cross-section in accordance with the provisions in Clause 1904.8 of these Specifications. Care shall be taken to properly align the sections connected so that the axis of the pile will be straight. The number of welded connections in the length of pile shall be as few as possible.\n\n# 1109 tiMBeR Piles\n\nThe Engineer shall stamp each pile on the butt with a stamp which shall make an impression that is readily legible. Treated timber piles will be inspected by the Engineer after treatment. Untreated timber piles may be used as test piles. Treated timber piles shall be driven within 6 months after treatment.\n\nTimber piles shall be furnished with tip protection and protected by the use of steel straps. Tip protection shall be suitable for use on timber piling of the size to be driven. Details of tip protection shall be furnished to the Engineer for review and approval before driving piles. Not less than 2 separate steel straps shall be placed within 600 mm of the butt of each pile after the pile is square cut. Not less than 2 separate steel straps shall be placed within 300 mm of the tip of each pile. Additional intermediate steel straps shall be placed at intervals of not more than 3 m measured along the length of the pile.\n\nTimber piles which are to be capped shall be separately cut off so that true bearing is obtained on every pile. Piles inaccurately cut off shall be replaced. Splicing of timer piles shall not be permitted except by written permission of the Engineer.\n\n# 1110 dRiVinG eQuiPMent\n\nPiles or their casings may be driven with any type of drop hammer, diesel hammer or single-acting steam or compressed air hammer, provided they penetrate to the prescribed depth to attain the designed resistance without being damaged. The weight or power of the hammer should be sufficient to ensure a penetration of at least 5 mm per blow unless rock has been reached. It is always preferable to employ the heaviest hammer practicable and to limit the stroke, so as not to damage the pile. The minimum weight of the hammer shall be 2.5t.\n\n466\n\n\nPile Foundations                                                                       Section 1100\n\n\nthe case of precast concrete piles the mass of the hammer shall be not less than 30 times the mass of 300 mm length of pile.\n\nSteam or air hammers shall be furnished along with boiler or air compressor of capacity at least equal to that specified by the manufacturer of the hammers. The boiler or air compressor shall be equipped with an accurate pressure gauge at all times. The valve mechanism and other parts of steam, air or diesel hammers shall be maintained in first class condition so that the length of stroke and number of blows per minute for which the hammer is designed, will be obtained. Inefficient steam, air or diesel hammers shall not be permitted to be used on the work.\n\n# 1111 dRiVinG\n\n# 1111.1 General Procedure\n\nDetails of the equipment and the method proposed for driving the piles shall be submitted for scrutiny and approval of the Engineer. Piles shall be installed from firm ground or from temporary supports or from fixed platform. The arrangement shall provide sufficient rigidity to ensure accuracy of pile driving under all conditions of tide, stream flow or hammer drop.\n\nDuring driving the top of pile shall be protected by a suitable helmet of substantial steel construction. The helmet shall provide uniform bearing across the top of the pile and shall hold the pile centrally under the hammer. No pile shall be driven unless inspected and approved by the Engineer.\n\nPiles shall be driven from a fixed frame of sufficient rigidity to ensure accuracy of driving within specified tolerances. The force of the hammer shall be directed centrally and axially during driving. Forces producing undue bending or torsional stresses in piles shall not be applied during driving.\n\nThe stroke of a single acting or drop hammer shall be limited to 1.2 m unless otherwise permitted by the Engineer. A shorter stroke may be necessary when there is danger of damaging the pile.\n\nPiles shall not be bent or sprung into position but shall be effectively guided and held on line during the initial stages of driving. Attempts to correct any tendency for the pile to run off line by the application of significant horizontal restraint will not be permitted. Shortly after the commencement of driving and at regular intervals throughout the driving operation, checks shall be made to ensure that the pile frame does not exert any undue lateral force on the pile due to restraint within the helmet.\n\nIf the indications are that a pile will finish outside the specified tolerances, driving operations on that pile will cease. The pile shall be withdrawn, the hole filled and the pile re-driven at the cost of the Contractor.\n\n\n467\n\n\nSection 1100\n# Pile Foundations\n\nTo avoid the possibility of premature \u201cset-up\u201d, pile driving shall be continuous in the later stages, without any deliberate stops. (delays of an hour or less may lead to significant \u201cset-up\u201d in piles i.e. resistance to further driving increases after driving is stopped).\n\nIf any pile is damaged in any way during driving, it shall be repaired or replaced as directed by the Engineer, at the cost of the Contractor. If during driving, the head of a pile is damaged to the extent that further driving is not possible, the head shall be cut off and driving continued. The cost of cutting off shall be borne by the Contractor and where, as a result of such cutting off the head, the pile is too short, the Contractor, shall, at his own cost, supply and splice on sufficient length of pile to restore the pile to its correct length.\n\nPiles should be driven to the minimum acceptable penetration shown on the drawings. This may require pre-boring and/or jetting as indicated in Clause 111.2, with the approval of the Engineer.\n\nPiles shall be driven to nominal refusal or the required ultimate dynamic capacity mentioned on the drawings or until the top of the pile is at the level required and specified on the drawing whichever gives the lowest toe elevation. The Engineer\u2019s decision in these matters shall be final. Nominal refusal shall be taken as equivalent to 25 mm total penetration for the final 20 blows using a hammer of driving energy as specified and shall be used as the criterion for acceptance for piles founded on rock. Severe driving which results in an average set per blow less than 0.5 mm will not be permitted.\n\nWhere hard drilling is encountered because of dense strata or obstructions located above the predetermined pile tip level, nominal refusal shall not be considered to have been achieved unless the Engineer is satisfied that the total number of blows, as the average driving resistance specified for nominal refusal, indicates that further driving will not advance the pile through dense strata or obstructions.\n\nThe pile shall be driven as accurately as possible to the vertical or to specified batter. Straining the pile into position can damage it and the driving equipment should be adjusted as much as possible to follow the position of the pile. Any deviation from the proper alignment shall be noted and promptly reported to the Engineer. If the deviation is to such an extent that the resulting eccentricity cannot be taken care of by strengthening the pile cap or pile tips, such a pile shall, at the discretion of the Engineer, be replaced or supplemented by an additional pile. Unless otherwise specified, the permissible positional deviation for piles shall be limited to those indicated in Clause 1116.\n\nCare shall be taken not to damage the pile by over-driving. Any sudden change in the rate of penetration which cannot be ascribed in the nature of the ground shall be noted and its cause ascertained, if possible, before driving is continued.\n\nWhile withdrawing a casing used in the construction of cast in-situ pile, consideration shall be given to the possibility of damaging any other nearby pile. The danger of damaging is greater\n\n468\n\nPile Foundations\n# Section 1100\n\nin compact soils than in loose soils. No pile shall be bored or driven within 3 m of a newly cast pile until at least 24 hours after completion of its installation.\n\nDriving piles in loose sand tends to compact the sand which in turn increases the skin friction. Therefore, driving a number of friction piles in a group shall proceed outward from the centre as otherwise it will be difficult to drive the inner piles to the same depth as the others.\n\nIn the case of stiff clay also, the driving for a group of piles shall proceed outward from the centre. However, in case of very soft soil, the driving may proceed from outside to inside, so that the soil is restrained from flowing out during driving operations.\n\nIf there is a major variation between the depth at which adjacent foundation piles in a group meet refusal, a boring shall be made nearby to ascertain the cause of this difference. If the boring shows that the soil contains pockets of highly compressive material below the level of the shorter pile, it will be necessary to enforce penetration of all the piles to a level below the bottom of the zone which shows such pockets.\n\n# 1111.2 Pre-boring and Jetting\n\nDriving of the piles may be assisted by pre-boring holes or by the use of jets or both, subject to the approval of the Engineer. These may be used essentially to achieve the minimum penetration shown on the drawings where such penetration is not reached under normal conditions of driving indicated in Clause 1111.1.\n\nThe diameter of the hole shall not be greater than the diagonal dimension of the pile less 100 mm.\n\nThe maximum depth of the pre-boring shall be such that the specified set (or less) is obtained when the toe of the pile is at founding level. Pre-boring shall be as approved by the Engineer and shall be carried out only up to a level of one metre above the founding level. The pile shall be driven for at least one metre below the pre-bored hole. To ensure that the pile is properly supported laterally in the hole, any space remaining around the pile at the ground level after driving is completed, shall be backfilled with approved granular material.\n\nWhen water jetting is used, at least two jets shall be attached to the pile symmetrically. The volume and pressure of water at the outlet nozzles shall be sufficient to freely erode material adjacent to the toe of the pile. The maximum depth up to which jetting is carried out, shall be such that the specified set (or less) is obtained when the toe of the pile is at founding level. Jetting shall cease as directed by the Engineer and shall proceed only up to 1 m above the founding level. The pile shall be driven at least 1 m below the pre-bored hole.\n\nTo avoid very hard driving and vibration in materials such as sand, jetting of piles by means of water may be carried out only with the express permission of the Engineer and in such a\n\n469\n\nSection 1100\n# Pile Foundations\n\nmanner as not to impair the bearing capacity of piles already in place, the stability of the soil or the safety of any adjoining buildings. Details of the arrangement for jetting shall be got approved from the Engineer in advance.\n\nIf large quantities of water are used for jetting, provision shall be made for collecting and draining away of water when it comes to the surface of the ground, so that the stability of the piling plant is not endangered by the softening of the ground.\n\nJetting shall be stopped before completing the driving which shall always be finished by ordinary methods. Jetting shall be stopped if there is any tendency for the pile tips to be drawn towards the pile already driven owing to the disturbance of the ground.\n\n# 1112 RaKeR (inClined) Piles\n\nThe maximum rake to be permitted in piles shall not exceed the following:\n\n- I) 1 in 6 for all bored piles\n- ii) 1 in 6 for cast in-situ piles\n- iii) 1 in 4 for precast driven piles\n\n# 1113 Pile tests\n\n# 1113.1 initial load test\n\n- i) The number of initial tests shall be determined by the Engineer taking into consideration the bore log and soil profile, design length, pile diameter and design pile capacity. However, it shall not be less than two for each category.\n- ii) Initial load test for axial load capacity, including uplift capacity if required, on trial piles of the same diameter as of the design pile, shall be carried out after 28 days design strength is achieved. The testing shall be done as per the procedure laid down in IS:2911, Part-IV. The load test shall be conducted for not less than 2\u00bd times the design load. The initial load test shall be cyclic load test for piles deriving strength from end bearing and side friction. The maintained load test can be performed for end bearing piles which do not rely on friction and for piles socketed in rock;\n- iii) If the initial load test gives a capacity greater than 25 percent of the capacity calculated by static formula and if it is desired to take benefit of the higher capacity, another two load tests shall be carried out to confirm the earlier value and minimum of the three shall be considered.\n\n470\n\nPile Foundations\n# Section 1100\n\nas initial load test value. The number of initial tests shall be determined by the Engineer taking into consideration the bore log and soil profile.\n\niv) Lateral load tests shall be carried out for estimating the lateral load capacity of the piles. The test procedure shall be carried out as per IS 2911 part IV. However the permissible deflection shall be as per IRC:78.\n\nv) In particular cases where upper part of pile is likely to be exposed later due to scour, then the capacity contributed by that portion of the pile during load test, shall be accounted for.\n\n# 1113.2 Routine load tests\n\nRoutine load test shall be carried out at actual locations of foundations of bridges to re-confirm or modify the allowable loads. The lateral load test may be conducted on two adjacent piles. However, results of routine load tests shall not be used for upward revision of design capacity of piles. The minimum number of tests to be conducted for confirming the capacity shall be as per table 1100-3.\n\n| total number of Piles for the Bridge | Minimum number of test Piles                                                |\n| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Upto 50                              | 2                                                                           |\n| 50-150                               | 3                                                                           |\n| Beyond 150                           | 2% of total piles (fractional number rounded to next higher integer number) |\n\nNote: The number of tests may be judiciously increased depending upon the variability of foundation strata. For determining the number of piles to be tested for the routine test the total no. of piles under all structures of left and right carriageway and the service road shall be taken together provided length and diameters of the piles are the same.\n\n# 1113.3 Permissible overload\n\nWhile conducting routine test on one of the piles belonging to a pile group, if the pile capacity is found to be deficient (based on the settlement criteria of 12 mm for piles of diameter up to and including 600 mm and 2 percent of the pile diameter for piles of diameter more than 600 mm at 1.5 times the design load) an overload up to 10 percent of the capacity may be allowed.\n\n# 1113.4\n\nFor a quick assessment of pile capacity, strain dynamic tests may be conducted after establishing co-relation using the results of load tests. However, results of strain dynamic tests shall not be used for upward revision of design capacity of pile. Detailed guidelines and references are given in IRC:78. These methods can be followed.\n\n471\n\nSection 1100\n# Pile Foundations\n\nTo have a fairly good idea about the quality of concrete and construction defects like voids, discontinuities etc., pile integrity tests are extensively conducted. Detailed guidelines in this connection are given in IRC:78.\n\n# 1114 Pile Cap\n\nCasting of pile cap should be at a level higher than low water level unless functionally required to be below low water level. In such cases dewatering shall be resorted to allow concreting in dry conditions. Pile caps shall be of reinforced concrete. A minimum offset of 150 mm shall be provided beyond the outer faces of the outermost piles in the group. If the pile cap is in contact with earth at the bottom, a leveling course of minimum 80 mm thickness of M 15 nominal mix concrete shall be provided. In marine conditions or areas exposed to the action of harmful chemicals, the pile cap shall be protected with a coating such as bituminous based coaltar epoxy or epoxy based coating or with suitable anti corrosive paint. Concrete with high alumina cement, shall not be used in marine environment.\n\nThe attachment of the pile head to the cap shall be adequate for the transmission of loads and forces. A portion of pile top may be stripped of concrete and the reinforcement anchored into the cap. Manual chipping may be permitted three days after casting of pile, while pneumatic tools for chipping shall be permitted only seven days after casting of pile. The top of pile after stripping shall project at least 50 mm into the pile cap.\n\nThe top of concrete in a pile shall be brought above cut-off level to permit removal of all laitance and weak concrete before pile cap is laid. This will ensure good concrete at the cut-off level.\n\n# 1115 Important Considerations, Inspection/Precautions for Different Types of Piles\n\n# 1115.1 Driven Cast in-situ Piles\n\n# 1115.1.1\n\nSpecialist literature and the guidelines from the pile construction industry shall be consulted regarding the method of installation, equipment and accessories for pile driving and recording of data.\n\n# 1115.1.2\n\nDuring installation of piles, the final \u201cset\u201d of penetration of pile per blow of hammer shall be checked taking an average of last 10 blows.\n\n# 1115.1.3\n\nThe pile shoes which may be of either cast iron conical type or mild steel flat type shall have double reams for proper seating of the removable casing tube inside the space between the reams.\n\n472\n\nPile Foundations\n# Section 1100\n\n1115.1.4 Before commencement of pouring of concrete, it shall be ensured that there is no ingress of water in the casing tube from the bottom. Further, adequate control during withdrawal of the casing tube is essential so as to maintain sufficient head of concrete inside the casing tube at all stages of withdrawal.\n\n1115.1.5 Concrete in piles shall be cast up to a minimum height of 600 mm above the designed top level of pile, which shall be stripped off at the time of construction of pile cap.\n\n# 1115.2 Bored Cast in-situ Piles\n\n1115.2.1 While concreting uncased piles, voids in concrete shall be avoided and sufficient head of concrete is to be maintained to prevent inflow of soil or water into the concrete. It is also necessary to take precautions during concreting to minimize the softening of the soil by excess water. Uncased cast in-situ piles shall not be allowed where mudflow conditions exist.\n\n1115.2.2 The drilling mud such as bentonite suspension shall be maintained at a level sufficiently above the surrounding ground water level throughout the boring process, to ensure the stability of the strata which is being penetrated until the pile has been concreted.\n\n1115.2.3 Where bentonite suspension is used to maintain the stability of the borehole, it is essential that the properties of the material be carefully controlled at stages of mixing, supply to the borehole and immediately before concrete is placed. It is usual to limit:\n\n- i) The density of bentonite suspension to 1.05 g/cc\n- ii) The marsh cone viscosity between 30 and 40\n- iii) The pH value between 9.5 and 12\n- iv) The silt content less than 1 percent\n- v) The liquid limit of bentonite not less than 400 percent\n\nThese aspects shall act as controlling factors for preventing contamination of bentonite slurry for clay and silt.\n\n1115.2.4 The bores shall be washed by bentonite flushing to ensure clean bottom at two stages viz. after completion of boring and prior to concreting after placing of reinforcement cage. Flushing of bentonite shall be done continuously with fresh bentonite slurry till the consistency of inflowing and outflowing slurry is similar.\n\n1115.2.5 For concreting of piles using tremie, Clause 1107 of these Specifications may be referred.\n\n1115.2.6 For very long or large diameter piles, use of retarding plasticizer in concrete is desirable.\n\n473\n\nSection 1100\n# Pile Foundations\n\n# 1115.2.7\n\nFor large diameter piles, it may be essential to conduct non-destructive pile integrity tests to evaluate integrity of the pile.\n\n# 1115.2.8\n\nWhere possible, it may be desirable to grout the base of pile with cement slurry under suitable pressure after concrete in the pile attains the desired strength. For this purpose, conduit pipes with easily removable plugs at the bottom end, should be placed in the bore along with reinforcement cage before concreting.\n\n# 1116 Tolerances\n\n# 1116.1 Permissible tolerances for Piles\n\n| i) Precast Concrete Piles:                                |                                        |        |                |\n| --------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------ | -------------- |\n| a) Variation in cross-sectional dimensions                |                                        | \u00b1 5 mm |                |\n| b) Variation in length                                    |                                        |        | \u00b1 25 mm        |\n| c) Surface irregularities measured with 3 m straight edge |                                        |        | 5 mm           |\n| d) Bow for total length of pile in mm                     | 1 mm/m length of pile limited to 20 mm |        |                |\n| ii) Driven Piles                                          |                                        |        |                |\n| a) Variation in cross-sectional dimensions                |                                        |        | +50 mm, -10 mm |\n| b) Variation from vertical for vertical piles             |                                        |        | 1 in 150       |\n| c) For vertical piles deviation at piling platform level  |                                        | 75 mm  |                |\n| d) Variation of level of top of piles                     |                                        |        | \u00b1 25 mm        |\n| iii) Bored Piles                                          |                                        |        |                |\n| a) Variation in cross-sectional dimensions                |                                        |        | +50 mm, -10 mm |\n| b) Variation from vertical for vertical piles             |                                        |        | 1 in 150       |\n| c) For vertical piles deviation at piling platform level  |                                        | 75 mm  |                |\n| d) Variation of level of top of piles                     |                                        |        | \u00b1 25 mm        |\n| iv) For raker piles from specified rake                   |                                        |        | 1 in 25        |\n\n# 1116.2 Permissible tolerances for Pile Caps\n\n| a) Variation in dimensions                      | +50 mm, -10 mm              |\n| ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |\n| b) Misplacement from specified position in plan | 15 mm                       |\n| c) Surface irregularities measured              | 5 mm with 3 m straight edge |\n| d) Variation of level of top of piles           | \u00b1 25 mm                     |\n\n474\n\nPile Foundations\n# Section 1100\n\n# 1117 tests and standards of acceptance\n\nThe materials shall be tested in accordance with these Specifications and shall meet the prescribed criteria and requirements.\n\nThe work shall conform to these Specifications and shall meet the prescribed standards of acceptance.\n\n# 1118 Measurements for Payment\n\nFor supply of precast concrete, timber or steel piles of specified cross-section, the measurement shall be in metres of the length of piles ordered in writing by the Engineer measured from the head to the butt of the shoe or the tapered point.

In such cases, the decision regarding adoption of pneumatic sinking shall be taken on the basis of results of confirmatory bores and as directed by the Engineer.\n\n# 1203 settinG out and PRePaRations FoR sinKinG\n\n# 1203.1\n\nNecessary reference points shall be accurately fixed to mark x-x axis along the direction of traffic and y-y axis normal to direction of traffic. Such reference points shall be away from the zone of blow-ups or possible settlements which may result from well sinking operations and shall be connected to the permanent stations with the base line on the banks. The centre of the individual wells shall be marked with reference to these stations. The distances between the wells shall be checked with the help of precision instruments.\n\n# 1203.2\n\nA temporary benchmark shall be established near the well foundation, away from the zone of blow-ups or possible settlement. The bench mark shall be checked regularly with respect to the permanent bench mark established at the bridge site.\n\n# 1203.3\n\nFor wells located on the banks of the river or in dry area, the bed may be\n\nSection 1200 Well Foundations\n\nprepared by excavating the soil up to 1.5 m, followed by levelling and dressing before placing the cutting edge.\n\n# 1203.4\n\nFor wells which are to be located in water, a sand island shall be constructed for laying the cutting edge and well curb. Sand islands are practicable for water depths of up to 5 m under stable bed soil conditions. Where the depth of water is greater than 5 m or in fast flowing rivers or for locations where soil is too weak to sustain sand island, floating caissons may have to be adopted.\n\nThe plan dimensions of sand islands shall be such as to have a working space of at least 2 m all around the steining of the well. Sand islands shall be maintained to perform their functions, until the well is sunk to a depth below the original bed level at least equal to the depth of water at that location.\n\nThe sand island shall be held in position and protected against scour by means of wooden ballies properly braced or sheet piles. The top level of the sand island to be decided by the Engineer, shall be sufficiently above the prevailing water level so that it is not affected by wave action.\n\n# 1203.5\n\nEquipment shall be deployed for construction of well foundation as required and as directed by the Engineer. Generally, the following equipment may be required for the work:\n\n- a) crane with grab buckets \u2013 capacity 0.5 cum to 2.0 cum\n- b) submersible pumps\n- c) air compressors, air locks and other accessories where pneumatic sinking of well is anticipated\n- d) chisels of appropriate sizes\n- e) aqua-header for cutting rocky strata\n- f) diving helmets and accessories\n- g) batching plants for concrete production\n- h) equipment for transportation, placing and compaction of concrete\n\n# 1204 Cutting Edge\n\n# 1204.1\n\nThe cutting edge shall be made from structural steel sections conforming to Section 1900 of these Specifications and shall be strong enough to facilitate sinking of the well through the type of strata expected to be encountered. The weight of the cutting edge shall not be less than 40 kg per metre length. It shall be properly anchored into the well curb as shown on the drawing.\n\n480\n\nWell Foundations\n# Section 1200\n\n# 1204.2\n\nWhen there are two or more compartments in a well, the bottom of the cutting edge of the inner walls shall be kept at about 300 mm above that of outer walls.\n\n# 1204.3\n\nIn V shaped cutting edge, the inclined plate should meet the vertical plate in such a way that full strength connection by welding is feasible.\n\n# 1204.4\n\nThe parts of cutting edge shall be erected on level firm ground about 300 mm above prevalent water level. Temporary supports shall be provided to facilitate fabrication and for maintaining the assembly in true shape. The fabrication may be carried out in the shop or at site. Steel sections shall not be heated and forced into shape. However, \u201cV\u201d cuts may be made in the horizontal portion, uniformly throughout the length, to facilitate cold bending. After bending, such \u201cV\u201d cuts should be closed by welding. Joints in the lengths of structural sections, unless otherwise specified, shall be fillet welded using single cover plate to ensure the requisite strength of the original section.\n\n# 1205 Well Curb\n\n# 1205.1\n\nThe well curb shall be such that it will offer minimum resistance while sinking but will be strong enough to be able to transmit superimposed loads from the steining to the bottom plug. The shape and outline dimensions of the curb shall be as shown in IRC:78. The internal angle of the curb shall be about 30\u00ba to 37\u00ba depending upon geotechnical data of the strata through which the well is to be sunk.\n\n# 1205.2\n\nThe well curb shall be in reinforced concrete having concrete mix in accordance with Table 1700-2 and Table 1700-3 and with minimum reinforcement of 72 kg/cum excluding bond rods. The steel shall be suitably detailed to prevent spreading and splitting of curb during sinking. The outer face of the curb shall be vertical. The bottom ends of vertical bond rods of steining shall be fixed securely to the cutting edge with check nuts or by welds. Concreting of the well curb shall be done in one continuous operation.\n\n# 1205.3\n\nSteel formwork for well curb shall be fabricated strictly in conformity with the drawing. The formwork on outer face of curb may be removed within 24 hours after concreting while that on inner face shall be removed only after 72 hours.\n\n# 1205.4\n\nIn case blasting is anticipated, the inner face of the well curb shall be protected with steel plates of thickness not less than 10 mm up to the top of the well curb. If considered necessary, the inner face of steining may also be protected with steel plates of 6 mm thickness up to a height of 3 m above the top of the well curb or as specified by the Engineer. The curb as well as 3 m height of steining above the curb, shall be provided with additional hoop reinforcement of 10 mm diameter bars at 150 mm spacing. Additional hoop reinforcement shall be provided in the steining for a further height of up to two times the thickness of steining above the plates, so as to avoid cracking which may arise on account of sudden change in the effective section due to curtailment of plate.\n\n481\n\nSection 1200\n# Well Foundations\n\n# 1206 Floating Caissons\n\n# 1206.1\n\nFloating caissons are generally fabricated at or near the banks on dry land or in dry docks and then towed into position. For floating caissons, a detailed method statement covering fabrication, floating and sinking operations, shall be prepared and furnished to the Engineer. Such statement shall include the total tonnage of steel involved, fabrication and welding specifications, list of materials and plant and a description of operations and manpower required for the work.\n\n# 1206.2\n\nFloating caissons shall be of structural steel conforming to Section 1900 of these Specifications. The joints of the fabricated structure shall be absolutely leak-tight and shall be checked against leakage before floating and being towed to site. The reinforcement of the curb and steining of the well shall be fixed inside the shell by welding before the caisson is floated. Stability of floating caissons shall be ensured against overturning and capsizing under the action of water current, wave pressure and wind while being towed and kept in position. To maintain the stability of the shell while being floated, it may be provided with ballast in the form of water filling up to required level or filling with small amount of concrete. It shall be ensured that the draught of the floating caisson is always less than the depth of water available, so as to facilitate its smooth hindrance-free movement while being towed.\n\n# 1206.3\n\nHeight of caisson shall be planned to ensure that at any given time, at least one metre of the shell shall be above water level. In case the location is affected by the action of waves, the height shall be suitably increased to avoid water spilling into the caisson. In case the bed has soft soil, the caisson shall be provided with 3 to 5 metres of additional height, as it may sink by itself after grounding in bed. Simultaneous sinking and concreting is required to prevent caisson from tilting. In sandy stratum especially with strong water current, appropriate additional height of caisson is necessary for accommodating local scour.\n\n# 1206.4\n\nThe floating caisson shall be held in position against untoward movement by wire ropes/chains, using winches mounted on stationary suitable platforms/buoys or similar anchoring systems. Anchoring in minimum three directions, shall be provided to prevent unacceptable longitudinal and lateral movement. The anchoring system shall permit small movements in order to facilitate correct positioning of the caisson at the exact location of the well and until the stage when it is just getting grounded. Special care is necessary where variation in water level is frequent, e.g. in tidal zones.\n\n# 1206.5\n\nAfter being held in correct position, concreting of the floating caisson shall be commenced. The concrete mixed in batching plants, shall be carried to the floating caisson on barges and placed in position through concrete pumps or tremie. When large volumes of concreting are involved, the batching plant concrete pump, crane etc, may all be mounted on a barge kept in the vicinity of the caisson. As no vibration is possible inside the shell, it shall be ensured that the concrete has a slump of 150 to 200; alternatively, self-compacting concrete can be used. The concrete shall be carefully placed uniformly all around the caisson so that it settles vertically without any tendency to tilt.\n\n482\n\nWell Foundations\n# Section 1200\n\n# 1207 Well steininG\n\n1207.1 The dimensions, shape, concrete strength and reinforcements of the well steining shall strictly conform to those shown on the drawings. The formwork shall preferably be of M.S. sheets shaped and stiffened suitably. In case timber forms are used, they shall be lined with plywood or M.S. sheets.\n\n1207.2 The height of the first lift of steining to be cast above the well curb shall not be more than 2 m and subsequent lifts shall not exceed the diameter of the well or the depth of well to be sunk below the bed level at any time. For stability, the first lift of steining shall be cast only after sinking the curb at least partially. Concreting of steining may be carried out in subsequent lifts of about 2 to 2.5 m. Attempts should be made to minimize the number of construction joints. The concreting layers shall be limited to 450 mm restricting the free fall of concrete to not more than 1.5 m. Laitance formed at the top surface of a lift shall be removed to expose coarse aggregates before setting of concrete at the proposed construction joint. As far as possible, construction joints shall not be kept at the location of laps in the vertical steining bars.\n\n1207.3 The steining of the well shall be built in one straight line from bottom to top such that if the well is titled, the next lift of steining will be aligned in the direction of the tilt. The work will be checked carefully with the aid of straight edges of lengths approved by the Engineer. Plumb bob or spirit level shall not be used for alignment. After sinking of a stage is complete, damaged portions if any, of steining at top of the previous stage shall be properly repaired before constructing the next stage.\n\n1207.4 For measuring the height of steining, it shall be marked with at least 4 gauges, two in traffic direction and two normal to traffic direction, distributed equally on the outer face of the well. The marking shall be in the form of a 100 mm wide strip painted on the steining, with every metre marked in black paint. Marking of the gauges shall be done carefully and accurately with a steel tape, starting with zero at the bottom of the cutting edge. The marking shall be continued upwards as each lift of steining is added.\n\n1207.5 After reaching the founding level, the well steining shall be inspected to check for any damage or cracks. The Engineer will direct and the Contractor shall execute the remedial measures, if required, before acceptance of the well steining. In case the well is found to be unacceptable even after remedial measures are carried out, then it shall stand rejected.\n\n# 1208 Well sinKinG\n\n# 1208.1 General\n\nThe well shall be sunk true and vertical through all types of strata. No well shall be permitted to be placed in a pre-dredged hole.\n\n483\n\nSection 1200\n# Well Foundations\n\nSinking or loading of the well with kentledge shall be commenced only after the steining has been cured for at least 48 hours or as specified in the drawings.\n\nThe well shall be sunk by excavating the material uniformly from inside the dredge hole using cranes with grab buckets of appropriate capacity. Use of water jetting, explosives and divers may be adopted for sinking of wells through difficult strata, with prior approval of the Engineer. Well sinking can also be carried out by jack down method.\n\nNormally dewatering of well should not be permitted as a means for sinking the well. It shall never be resorted to if there is any danger of sand blowing under the well. Dewatering shall however be done when well is to be founded in rock. Pneumatic sinking may have to be resorted to where obstacles such as tree trunks, large sized boulders etc. are met or when there is hard strata which cannot be removed by open dredging. The necessity for adopting pneumatic sinking shall be decided by the Engineer.\n\nComplete history of sinking of each well giving details of concreting, sinking and problems met, if any, shall be maintained in the format given in Appendix 1200/I.\n\n# 1208.2 Sand Blows in Wells\n\nDewatering of the well shall not be carried out if sand blows are expected. Any equipment or men working inside the well, shall be brought outside the well as soon as there are any indications of sand blow occurring. Sand blow can often be minimized by keeping the level of water inside the well higher than the water table and also by adding heavy kentledge.\n\n# 1208.3 Use of Kentledge for Sinking of Well\n\nKentledge shall be placed in an orderly and safe manner on the loading platform and in such a way that it does not interfere with the excavation of the material from inside the dredge hole and also does not in any way damage the steining of the well.\n\nWhere tilt has occurred or there is a danger of well developing a tilt, the position of the load shall be regulated in such a manner as to provide greater sinking effort on the higher side of the well.\n\n# 1208.4 Use of Water Jetting\n\nWater jetting can be used to facilitate sinking of wells through clay/hard strata. The decision regarding use of water jetting shall be taken at the design stage itself, based on geotechnical investigations which may be indicating presence of hard, clayey strata. For carrying out water jetting, the required number of steel pipes of 40 to 50 mm diameter shall be embedded in the steining of the well, spaced evenly around its periphery. The bottom of the steel pipe shall taper down to a nozzle exiting in the sloping face of the well curb. The diameter of the nozzle\n\n\n\nWell Foundations\n# Section 1200\n\nshall be 6 mm. The steel pipe shall be kept about 1m above the top of each lift of steining, so that it can be extended by means of suitable couplers before the next lift of steining is cast. When the well reaches the hard strata and the need for water jetting arises, the tops of the embedded pipes shall be connected to pumps of required capacity for pumping in water at high pressure. The water jet issuing from the nozzle of the pipe under high pressure, cuts through the hard material and loosens it, permitting the well to sink at a faster rate than would otherwise have been possible. When water jetting is to be adopted, the Contractor shall furnish a method statement for approval of the Engineer covering all aspects of the work including the number, capacity and location of the high pressure pumps and other ancillaries required for executing the work.\n\n# 1208.5 use of Jack down Method\n\nThe jack down method of sinking shall be adopted as per requirement or as directed by the Engineer. The first step shall be to install ground anchors outside the periphery of the well. The number, location and depth of ground anchors are decided based on the properties of the surrounding soil to develop the necessary resisting force through skin friction. The drill holes of about 150 mm diameter along with casings shall be taken down to a depth of about 20 m or more below the founding level of the well, depending on requirements of design. After the holes have been drilled to the required depth, prestressing strands of adequate diameter and capacity are cut to the desired length and lowered into the holes. The holes shall then be grouted with cement slurry with non-shrink additive. Once the grouting is completed till the ground level, the casing is removed. The removal of the casing shall be done before the grout sets. In case rock is met with, the anchors shall be socketed into rock.\n\nHeavy duty pressurization girders fabricated of steel, shall be placed over stools resting on the steining of the well, against which the hydraulic jacks connected to the ground anchors, can exert pressure to push the well down. The hydraulic jacks shall be of capacity 500 T or more as per requirement. Before applying pressure from the jacks, 1 m deep sump is created inside the well by dredging. Pressure on different jacks is exerted in such a manner as to neutralize any tendency of the well to tilt. With the use of the jacks and controlled dredging, high rates of sinking can be achieved and the chances of sand blowing can also be reduced.\n\nFor use of jack down method of sinking, the Contractor shall furnish a method statement for approval of the Engineer, giving full details of construction of ground anchors, fabrication of pressurizing girder, type, number and capacity of jacks to be used, method of dredging and application of jack down force and all other relevant aspects for proper execution of the work.\n\n# 1208.6 use of explosives\n\nMild explosive charges may be used as an aid for sinking of the well. All prevalent laws\n\n485\n\nSection 1200\n# Well Foundations\n\nConcerning handling, storing and using of explosives shall be strictly followed. All safety precautions shall be taken as per IS:4081 \u201cSafety Code for Blasting and related Drilling Operations\u201d, to the extent applicable, whenever blasting is resorted to.\n\nWhen the likelihood of resorting to blasting is predicted in advance, protection of the bottom portion of the well shall be done as per Clause 1205.4.\n\nBlasting of any sort shall be done only with prior permission and in the presence of the Engineer. Blasting shall not be done before the concrete in the steining has hardened sufficiently and is more than 7 days old.\n\nAfter blasting operations are completed, the well curb and steining should be examined for any cracks and remedial measures taken if required.\n\nIf blasting has been done after the well has reached the design foundation level, normally 24 hours shall be allowed to lapse before the bottom plug is laid.\n\nThe charges shall be exploded well below the cutting edge by making a sump so as to avoid chances of any damage to the curb or to the steining of the well. A minimum sump of 1 m depth should be made before resorting to blasting. Use of large charges, 0.7 kg or above, may not be allowed, except under expert direction and with the permission of the Engineer.\n\nThe pattern of charges may be suitably arranged with delay detonators so as to reduce the number of charges fired at a time. The burden of the charge may be limited to 1 m and the spacing of holes may normally be kept as 0.5 m to 0.6 m.\n\nThere should be no equipment inside the well nor shall there be any worker in the close vicinity of the well at the time of exploding the charges.\n\nIf rock blasting is to be done for seating of the well, the damage caused by flying debris should be minimised by covering blasting holes with rubber mats before detonating the charge.\n\n# 1208.7 use of divers\n\nDivers may be used for removal of obstructions during sinking, carrying out rock blasting and for inspection. All safety precautions shall be taken as per any acceptable safety code or any statutory regulations in force, when divers carry out work under water in the well.\n\nOnly persons trained in diving operations shall be employed after being certified fit for diving by an approved doctor. They shall work under expert supervision. The raising of the diver from the bottom of wells shall be controlled so that decompression rate conforms to the rate as laid down in relevant regulations.\n\nThe diving and other equipment shall be of acceptable standard and certified to this effect by an approved independent agency. They shall be well maintained as per requirements for safe use.\n\n486\n\nWell Foundations\n# Section 1200\n\nArrangement for ample supply of low pressure clean cool air shall be ensured through an armoured flexible hose pipe. Standby compressor shall be provided to cover the contingency of breakdown of the compressor.\n\nSeparate high pressure connection shall be made for use of pneumatic tools. Electric lights where provided shall be at 50 volts (maximum).\n\n# 1208.8 use of Pneumatic sinking\n\n# 1208.8.1 General\n\nThe Engineer shall familiarize himself with particular reference to \u2018caisson diseases\u2019 and working of the medical air-lock. A doctor competent to deal with cases of \u2018caisson diseases\u2019 or other complications arising as a result of working under high pressure, shall be stationed at the construction site when pneumatic sinking is under progress.\n\nThe Contractor shall provide complete facilities and ensure strict enforcement of the requirements outlined in these specifications.\n\nSafely provisions as contained in IS:4138 and in these specifications shall be strictly followed.\n\nPneumatic sinking shall be limited to a depth of 30 m below ground level.\n\n# 1208.8.2 Man locks and shafts\n\nLocks, reducers, and shaft used in connection with caissons shall be of riveted construction throughout. The material used in their manufacture shall be steel plate with thickness not less than 6 mm.\n\nShafts shall be subjected to hydrostatic or air pressure test so as to ensure leak-tightness at a pressure of at least 0.5 MPa. The pressure at which testing has been done shall be clearly and visibly displayed.\n\nThe shaft shall be provided with safe, proper and suitable staircase for its entire length including landing platforms which shall be not more than 6 m apart. Where this is impracticable due to space constraints, suitable ladders along with landing platforms shall be installed. These shall be kept clear and in good condition at all times and shall be constructed, inspected and maintained to the entire satisfaction of the Engineer.\n\nA 1 m wide platform with 1 m high railing shall be provided all round the caisson air locks. Where 15 or more men are employed, caissons shall have two locks, one of which shall be used as a man-lock.\n\n487\n\nSection 1200\n# Well Foundations\n\nLocks shall be located so that the lowest part of the bottom door shall not be less than 1 m above the highest water level in the well.\n\nThe supply of fresh air to the working chamber shall at all times be sufficient to permit work to be done without any danger or excessive discomfort. All air supply lines shall be fitted with check valves.\n\nA man lock shall be used solely for the compression or decompression of workers and not for the passage of plant and material and shall be maintained in a reasonably clean and sufficiently warm state. However, any hand tool or hand instruments used for the purpose of the work may be carried into the man lock.\n\nWhere it is not reasonably practicable to provide a separate man lock for use by workers only, the lock when it is in actual use for compression or decompression of a person, shall be in a reasonably clean and sufficiently warm state and shall not be put simultaneously to any other use.\n\n# 1208.8.3 Valves\n\nExhaust valves shall be provided, having risers extending to the upper part of the chamber. These shall be operated, whenever necessary specially after a blast. Precautions shall be taken that men are not allowed to resume work after a blast, until the gas and smoke have cleared.\n\n# 1208.8.4 Medical Supervision and Certification\n\nEvery employee absent from work for 10 or more consecutive days due to illness or any other disability, shall be required to pass the regular physical examination by the doctor before being permitted to return to work.\n\nAfter a person has been employed continuously in compressed air for a period of 2 months, he shall be re-examined by the doctor and shall not be permitted to work until such re-examination has been made and the report is satisfactory.\n\nNo person known to be addicted to the excessive use of intoxicants shall be permitted to work in compressed air.\n\nThe doctor shall, at all times, keep a complete and full record of examination made by him, which shall contain dates of examinations, a clear and full description of the persons examined, his age and physical condition at the time of examination and a statement as to the period for which he has been engaged in such work. Records shall be kept at the place where the work is in progress and shall be subject to inspection by authorized officers.\n\n488\n\nWell Foundations\n# Section 1200\n\nEvery man lock shall always have a doctor or a responsible person in attendance. In case the person in charge is not a doctor, he must have positive means of promptly communicating with and securing the services of a competent doctor in case of emergency. Such arrangements shall invariably be subject to the approval of the Engineer.\n\nAll cases of compressed-air illness shall be reported and copies of all such reports shall be kept in file at the place of work.\n\n# 1208.8.5 lighting\n\nAll lighting in compressed air chambers shall be operated only by electricity. Two independent electric lighting systems with independent sources of supply shall be used. These shall be so arranged that the emergency source shall become automatically operative in case of failure of the regularly used source.\n\nThe minimum intensity of light on any walkway ladder, stairway, or lower working level shall be one-quarter (1/4) candlepower. In all work places, the lighting shall always be such as to enable workmen to see their way about clearly. All external parts of lighting fixtures and electrical equipment lying within 2.5 m above the floor shall be constructed of non-combustible, non-absorbing insulating materials. If metal is used, it must be effectively earthed. Portable lamp shall have non-combustible, non-absorbing insulating sockets, approved handles, basket guards and approved cables. The use of worn out or defective portable and pendant conductors is prohibited.\n\n# 1208.8.6 safety against Fire Hazard\n\nNo oil, gasoline, or other combustible material shall be stored within 30 m of any shaft, caisson or tunnel opening. It shall be positively ensured that leaking flammable liquids do not flow into such areas. Oil may be stored in suitable tanks in isolated fireproof buildings, which are not less than 15 m away from any shaft, caisson, or tunnel opening or any building directly connected thereto.\n\nWhere feasible, a fire hose connected to a suitable source of water shall be provided at the top of every caisson. Where fire mains are not accessible, water shall be stored in tanks near the top of every caisson, provided fire pails or suitable pumps are kept available. Approved fire extinguishers shall also be provided.\n\n# 1208.8.7 sanitation\n\nProperly heated, lighted and ventilated dressing rooms shall be provided for all employees engaged in compressed air work. Such rooms shall contain lockers and benches and be open and accessible to person during intermissions between shifts. Adequate toilet accommodation of one for every twenty five employees shall be provided.\n\n489\n\nSection 1200\n# Well Foundations\n\nCare shall be taken to keep all parts of the caissons and other working compartments, including locker rooms, dry rooms, rest rooms and other equipment in good sanitary condition and free from refuse, decaying or other objectionable matter.\n\nSmoking shall be strictly prohibited and matches and smoking materials shall not be allowed to be brought into the locker rooms.\n\nA separate dry room shall be provided where working clothes may be dried in a reasonable time.\n\n# 1208.8.8 Protection against Gases\n\nIn all cases where release of gas is expected as in the case of sinking through alluvium impregnated with decayed vegetable matter, the use of Davy Safety Lamp shall be compulsory.\n\n# 1208.8.9 Additional Safety Provisions\n\n- a) The weight of the pneumatic platform and that of steining and kentlege, if any, shall be sufficient to resist the uplift from air inside, skin friction being neglected in this case. If at any section, the total weight acting downwards is less than the uplift pressure of air inside, additional kentledge shall be placed on the well.\n\nIf it is not possible to make the well heavy enough during excavation, \u201cblowing down\u201d may be used. The men should be withdrawn and air pressure reduced. The well should then begin to move with small reduction in air pressure. \u201cBlowing down\u201d should only be used when the ground is such that it will not heave up inside the chamber when the pressure is reduced. When the well does not move with the reduction in air pressure, kentledge should be added. \u201cBlowing down\u201d should be in short stages and the drop should not exceed, 0.5 m at any stage. To control sinking during blowing down, use of packing is recommended.\n- b) The pneumatic sinking plant and other allied machinery shall not only be of proper design and make, but also shall be operated by competent and well trained personnel. Every part of the machinery and its fixtures shall be minutely examined before installation and use. Availability of appropriate spares, standbys, safety of personnel as recommended in IS:4138 for working in compressed air must be ensured at site. Codes for safety and for working in compressed air and other labour laws and practices prevalent in the country, as specified to provide safe, efficient and expeditious sinking shall be followed.\n\n490\n\nWell Foundations\n# Section 1200\n\nc) Inflammable materials shall not be taken into air locks and smoking shall be prohibited. Wherever gases are suspected to be issuing out of dredge hole, the same shall be analysed by trained personnel and necessary precautions adopted to avoid hazard to life and equipment.\n\nd) Where blasting is resorted to, it shall be carefully controlled and all required precautions shall be observed. Workers shall be allowed inside after blasting only when a competent and qualified person has examined the chamber and steining thoroughly and found the same to be safe.\n\n# 1208.9 Precautions during sinking\n\na) When wells have to be sunk close to each other and clear distance between them is less than the diameter of wells, sinking shall be taken up on all wells and they shall be sunk alternately so that the sinking proceeds uniformly. Simultaneous and even dredging shall be carried out in the wells in such a manner that the difference in the levels of the sump and cutting edge in the adjacent wells does not exceed half the clear gap between them. Plugging of all the wells shall be done together.\n\nb) During sinking of double D-shaped wells, the excavation in both the dredge holes should be carried out simultaneously and equally.\n\nc) Bore chart shall be referred to constantly during sinking for taking adequate care while piercing different types of strata. The type of soil as obtained during the well sinking should be compared with bore chart so as to take prompt decisions.\n\nd) Before seasonal floods, all wells on which sinking is in progress shall be sunk to sufficient depths below the designed scour level. Further, they shall be temporarily filled and plugged so that they do not suffer any tilt or shift during the floods.\n\ne) All necessary precautions shall be taken against any possible damage to the foundations of existing structures in the vicinity of the wells, prior to commencement of dredging from inside the well.\n\nf) The dredged material shall not be allowed to accumulate around the well. It shall be dumped and spread, as far away as possible, and then continuously and simultaneously removed, as directed by the Engineer. In case the river stream flows along one edge of the well being sunk, the dredged material shall not be dumped on the dry side of the bank but on the side on which the river current flows.\n\ng) Very deep sump shall not be made below the well curb, as it entails risk of jumping (sudden sinking) of the well. The depth of sump shall\n\n491\n\nSection 1200\n# Well Foundations\n\nbe generally limited to one-sixth of the outer diameter/least lateral dimension of the well in plan. Normally the depth of sump shall not exceed 3.0 m below the level of the cutting edge unless otherwise specially permitted by the Engineer.\n\n- In case a well sinks suddenly with a jerk, the steining of the well shall be examined to the satisfaction of the Engineer to see that no damage has occurred to it.\n- In pneumatic sinking, the well shall not, at any time, be dropped to a depth greater than 500 mm by the method of \u201cblowing down\u201d.\n- Dewatering shall be avoided if sand blows are expected. Any equipment and men working inside the well shall be brought out of the well as soon as there are any indications of a sand-blow.\n- Sand blowing in wells can often be minimized by keeping the level of water inside the well higher than the water table and also by adding heavy kentledge.\n- In soft strata prone to settlement/creep, the construction of the abutment wells shall be taken up only after the approach embankment for a sufficient distance near the abutment, has been completed.\n\n# 1208.10 tilts and shifts\n\nUnless otherwise specified, the tilt of any well i.e. its inclination from the vertical, shall not exceed 1 (horizontal) in 80 (vertical). The shift of the well i.e. the horizontal displacement of the centre of the well at the founding level from its theoretical position, shall not be more than 150 mm in any resultant direction.\n\nTilts and shifts shall be carefully checked and recorded regularly during sinking operations in the format given in Appendix 1200/II. For the purpose of measuring the tilts along the two axes of the bridge, reduced level of the marks painted on the surface of the steining of the well shall be taken. For determination of shift, locations of the ends of the two diameters shall be precisely measured along the two axes, with reference to fixed reference points.\n\nWhenever any tilt is noticed, adequate corrective measures like placing eccentric kentledge, pulling, strutting, anchoring or depositing more dredged material outside the tilted face, water/air jetting, shall be adopted before any further sinking. After correction, the dredged material shall be removed and disposed of sufficiently away from the affected well. In case of sinking by jack down method tilt can be controlled by suitably adjusting jack down pressure on one side.\n\nA pair of wells close to each other have a tendency to come closer while sinking. Timber struts may be introduced in between the steining of these wells to prevent such movement.\n\n492\n\nWell Foundations\n# Section 1200\n\nTilts occurring in a well during sinking in dipping rocky strata can be controlled by suitably supporting the curb.\n\nIn the event of a well developing tilt or shift beyond the specified permissible values, the Contractor shall have to carry out, at his own cost, suitable remedial measures to the satisfaction of the Engineer, to bring the tilt and shift within permissible values.\n\nIf the resultant tilt and shift of any well exceeds 1 in 80 or 150 mm respectively the well so sunk shall be regarded as not conforming to specification and classified as substandard work. The Engineer in his sole discretion, may consider accepting such a well, provided:\n\n- Calculations for foundation pressures and steining stresses, accounting for the actual tilt and shift furnished by the Contractor show that the well is safe. Remedial measures required to bring the stresses within permissible values (such as increase in the dimension of the well cap, provision of dummy weights on the well cap etc.), shall be carried out by the Contractor at his own cost.\n- The Contractor shall be subjected to reduction in rates as a penalty in accordance with Clause 1215(g).\n\nIn case the Engineer, in his discretion, rejects the well, the Contractor shall dismantle the rejected well to the extent directed by the Engineer and remove the debris. Further, the Contractor shall at his own risk and cost, complete the bridge with modified span arrangement acceptable to the Engineer.\n\n# 1208.11 Seating of Wells\n\nThe well shall be uniformly seated on the founding strata. It shall be ensured by test borings that the properties of the soil encountered at the founding level and up to a depth of one and a half times the well diameter, is identical to that adopted in the design. The procedure for test boring shall be in accordance with the provisions of these Specifications. In case the soil encountered is inferior to that adopted in design, the well shall be re-designed by the Engineer adopting the soil properties actually encountered and the founding level intimated to the Contractor, who shall carry out the work accordingly.\n\nIn case of seating of wells in hard rocky strata, where the rock profile is steeply sloping, pneumatic methods of sinking may be adopted to seat the well evenly as directed by the Engineer. The decision of adopting pneumatic sinking shall be taken by the Engineer. The cutting edge may also be embedded for a suitable depth in the rocky strata, as decided by the Engineer keeping in view the quality of rock. A sump of depth 300 mm in hard rock or 600 mm in ordinary rock shall be made inside the well by chiselling or blasting as approved by Engineer. Diameter of sump shall be 1.5 m to 2 m less than that of the dredge hole.\n\n493\n\nSection 1200\n\n# Well Foundations\n\nThe well has been evenly seated on good hard rock, arrangements shall be made to facilitate proper inspection in dry and visible conditions before the bottom plug is laid.\n\n# 1209 Bottom Plug\n\nA bottom plug of concrete shall be provided in all wells, the top level of which shall be kept a minimum of 300 mm above the top of the curb, as shown in IRC:78. A suitable sump shall be made below the level of the cutting edge. Before concreting the bottom plug, it shall be ensured that the inside faces of curb and steining have been cleaned thoroughly.\n\nThe concrete mix used in bottom plug shall have a minimum cement content of 330 kg per cu.m with a slump about 150 mm, to permit easy flow of concrete through tremie to fill up all cavities. Concrete shall be laid in one continuous operation till the dredge hole is filled to the required height. For underwater concreting, the concrete shall be placed by tremie under still water condition and the minimum cement content shall not be less than 330 kg/m\u00b3 inclusive of all mineral admixtures, if added.\n\nIn case of grouted concrete, the grout mix shall not be leaner than 1:2. It shall be ensured that the grout fills up all interstices up to the top of the bottom plug by suitable means such as, controlling the rate of pumping etc.\n\nAny dewatering required, shall only be done 7 days after casting of bottom plug. The concrete production and placement equipment should be sufficient to enable underwater concreting within stipulated time. Necessary standby equipment should be available for emergency situation.\n\nBefore commencing plugging, all loose material from the bottom of the well shall be removed. Concreting shall be done in one continuous operation till the dredge hole is filled up to the required height and thereafter soundings shall be taken to ensure that the concrete has been laid to the required height. Least disturbance shall be caused to the water inside the well while laying concrete in the bottom plug. The concrete after placing, shall not be disturbed in any way for at least 7 days.\n\nIn order to check whether there is any rise in the level of the bottom plug, soundings should be taken at the close of concreting and once every day for the next 3 days.\n\nThe soundness of the bottom plug may be tested by dewatering the well to a level 5 m below the surrounding water level and checking the rise of water. For foundation subjected to artesian pressure, the depth of dewatering by 5 m shall be measured from the still water level created inside the well by the construction of false steining. The rate of rise shall preferably be less than 10 cm per hour. In case the rate is higher, suitable remedial measures as directed by the Engineer, shall be taken by the Contractor at his own cost.\n\n494\n\nWell Foundations\n# Section 1200\n\n# 1210 sand FillinG\n\nSand filling shall commence 7 days after laying of bottom plug. The level of the top of the bottom plug shall be verified before starting sand filling.\n\nThe sand shall be clean and free from earth, clay clods, roots, boulders, shingles, etc. and shall be compacted as directed. Sand filling shall be carried out up to the level shown on the drawing or as directed by the Engineer.\n\n# 1211 toP PluG\n\nAfter filling sand up to the required level, a top plug of 300 mm thick concrete of grade M 15, shall be provided over it as shown on the drawing or as directed by the Engineer.\n\n# 1212 Well CaP\n\nA reinforced cement concrete well cap will be provided over the top of the steining in accordance with the drawing. Formwork will be prepared conforming to the shape of well cap. In case sand filling has been carried out up to the top of the well, the concrete of the well cap may be laid directly on it after it has been suitably levelled. Otherwise, suitable shuttering supported on the inside of the steining, shall be provided for carrying the weight of the green concrete of the well cap.\n\nConcreting shall be carried out in dry condition. A properly designed false steining may be provided where required, to ensure that the well cap is laid in dry condition.\n\nThe bottom of the well cap shall be laid preferably as low as possible but above the LWL in the active channel. Where the bed level is higher than the LWL, the top of the well cap may be suitably raised and kept 1m below existing ground level.\n\nBond rods of steining shall be anchored into the well cap.\n\n# 1213 toleRanCes\n\nThe permissible tilt and shift shall not exceed 1 (horizontal) in 80 (vertical) and the shift at the well base shall not be more than 150 mm in any resultant direction.\n\nFor the well steining and well cap, the permissible tolerances shall be as follows:\n\n| a) Variation in dimension | +50 mm, -10 mm |\n| ------------------------- | -------------- |\n\n495\n\nSection 1200 Well Foundations\n\nb) Misplacement from specified position in plan: 15 mm\n\nc) Surface unevenness measured with 3 m straight edge: 5 mm\n\nd) Variation of level at the top: \u00b1 25 mm\n\n# 1214 tests and standards of acceptance\n\nThe materials shall be tested in accordance with these Specifications and shall meet the prescribed criteria.\n\nThe work shall conform to these Specifications and shall meet the prescribed standards of acceptance.\n\n# 1215 Measurements for Payment\n\nAll quantities shall be measured from the drawing, or as ordered by the Engineer, excepting those required to be provided by the Contractor at his cost.\n\n- a) The structural steel in cutting edge shall be measured in tonnes based on the net weight of metal used in it, as per Section 1900 of these Specifications.\n- b) The concrete in curb, well steining and well cap shall be measured in cubic metres in each of the items as per Section 1700 of these Specifications.\n- c) The steel reinforcement shall be measured in tonnes separately in each of the items, as per Section 1600 of these Specifications.\n- d) The measurement for well sinking shall be made in running metres for different depths and in different types of strata (e.g. predominantly sand/clay soil, ordinary rock, hard rock etc.) as specified in the contract.

Cement shall be proportioned by weight, taking the unit weight of cement as 1.44 tonne per cubic metre. Sand shall be proportioned by volume with due allowance for bulking. All mortar shall be mixed with a minimum quantity of water to produce desired workability consistent with required density. The mix shall be clean and free from soil, acid, alkali, organic matter or other deleterious substances.\n\nThe mixing shall be done in a mechanical mixer operated manually or by power. As an exception, hand mixing can also be resorted to as long as uniform density of the mix and its strength are assured. Hand mixing shall be permitted only for very small and isolated works like CD works, subject to the prior approval of the Engineer. Hand mixing shall be carried out on a clean watertight platform, where cement and sand shall be first mixed dry in the required proportion by being turned over and over, backwards and forwards, several times till the mixture is of uniform colour. Thereafter, minimum quantity of water shall be added to bring the mortar to the consistency of a stiff paste. The mortar shall be mixed for at least two minutes after addition of water.\n\nMortar shall be mixed only in such quantity as required for immediate use. The mix which has developed initial set shall not be used. Initial set of mortar with ordinary Portland Cement shall normally be considered to have taken place in 30 minutes after mixing. In case the mortar has stiffened during initial setting time because of evaporation of water, it can be re-tempered by adding water as frequently as needed to restore the requisite consistency, but such re-tempering shall not be permitted 30 minutes after mixing. Mortar remaining unused for more than 30 minutes after mixing, shall be rejected and removed from site of work.\n\n501\n\nSection 1300 Brick Masonry\n\n# 1304.2 Testing of Mortar\n\nNecessary tests to determine compressive strength of the mortar, its consistency and water resistivity shall be carried out in accordance with IS:2250. For compressive strength tests, the frequency of testing shall be 1 cube for every 2 cu.m of mortar, subject to a minimum of 3 cubes for a day\u2019s work.\n\n# 1305 Soaking of Bricks\n\nAll bricks shall be thoroughly soaked in a tank filled with water for a minimum period of one hour prior to being laid. Soaked bricks shall be removed from the tank sufficiently in advance so that they are skin dry at the time of actual laying. Such soaked bricks shall be stacked at a clean place where they are not contaminated with dirt, earth, etc.\n\n# 1306 Joints\n\nThe thickness of joints shall not exceed 10 mm. All joints on exposed faces shall be tooled to give concave finish.\n\n# 1307 Laying\n\nAll brickwork shall be laid in an English bond, even and true to line, plumb and level and all joints accurately kept in accordance with the drawing or as directed by the Engineer. Half and cut bricks shall not be used except when necessary to complete the bond. Closer in such cases shall be cut to the required size and used near the ends of the walls. The bricks used at the face and also at all angles forming the junction of any two walls shall be selected whole bricks of uniform size, with true and rectangular faces.\n\nAll bricks shall be laid with frogs up on a full bed of mortar except in the case of tile bricks. Each brick shall be properly bedded and set in position by slightly pressing while laying, so that the mortar gets into all its surface pores to ensure proper adhesion. All head and side joints shall be completely filled by applying sufficient mortar to brick already placed and on brick to be placed. All joints shall be properly flushed and packed with mortar so that no hollow spaces are left. No bats or cut bricks shall be used except to obtain dimensions of the different courses for specified bonds or wherever a desired shape so requires.\n\nThe brick work shall be built in uniform layers and for this purpose, wooden straight edge with graduations indicating thickness of each course including joint shall be used. Corners and other advanced work shall be raked back. Brickwork shall be done true to plumb or in specified batter. All courses shall be laid truly horizontal, and vertical joints shall be truly vertical. Vertical joints in alternate courses shall come directly one over the other. During construction, no part of work shall rise more than one metre above the general construction level, to avoid unequal settlement and improper jointing. Where this is not possible, the work shall be raked back according to the bond (and not toothed) at an angle not steeper than 45 degree with prior approval of the Engineer. Toothing may also be permitted where future extension is contemplated.\n\n502\n\nBrick Masonry\n# Section 1300\n\nBefore laying bricks in foundation, the foundation slab shall be thoroughly hacked, swept clean and wetted. A layer of mortar not less than 12 mm thick shall be spread on the surface of the foundation slab before the first course of bricks is laid.\n\n# 1308 Jointing old and New Work\n\nWhere fresh masonry is to join with masonry that is partially/entirely set, the exposed jointing surface of the set masonry shall be cleaned, roughened and wetted, so as to achieve the best possible bond with the new work. All loose bricks and mortar or other material shall be removed.\n\nIn the case of vertical or inclined joints, it shall be further ensured that proper bond between the old and new masonry is obtained by interlocking the bricks. Any portion of the brickwork that has been completed, shall remain undisturbed until thoroughly set.\n\nIn case of sharp corners specially in skew bridges, a flat cutback of 100 mm shall be provided so as to have proper and bonded laying of bricks.\n\n# 1309 Curing\n\nGreen work shall be protected from rain by suitable covering and shall be kept constantly moist on all faces for a minimum period of seven days. Brick work carried out during the day shall be suitably marked indicating the date on which the work was done, so as to keep a watch on the curing period. The top of the masonry work shall be left flooded with water at the close of the day. Watering shall be done carefully so as not to disturb or wash out the green mortar.\n\nDuring hot weather, all finished or partly completed work shall be covered or wetted in such a manner as to prevent rapid drying of the brickwork.\n\nDuring the period of curing, the brick work shall be suitably protected from all damages. At the close of day\u2019s work or for other period of cessation, watering and curing shall have to be maintained. Should the mortar perish i.e. become dry, white or powdery through neglect of curing, work shall be pulled down to the extent required and rebuilt as directed by the Engineer.\n\nIf any stains appear during watering, the same shall be removed from the surface.\n\n# 1310 Scaffolding\n\nThe scaffolding shall be sound, strong and safe to withstand all loads likely to come upon it. The holes which provide resting space for horizontal members shall not be left in masonry under one metre in width or immediately near the skew backs of arches. The holes left in the masonry work for supporting the scaffolding shall be filled and made good. Scaffolding shall be got approved by the Engineer, but its safety shall be the responsibility of the Contractor.\n\n503\n\nSection 1300\n# Brick Masonry\n\n# 1311 eQuiPMent\n\nAll tools and equipment used for mixing, transporting and laying of mortar and bricks shall be clean and free from set mortar, dirt or other injurious foreign substances.\n\n# 1312 FinisHinG oF suRFaCes\n\n# 1312.1 General\n\nAll brickwork shall be finished in a workmanlike manner with the thickness of joints, manner of striking or tooling as described in these specifications. The surfaces can be finished by jointing, pointing or plastering, as shown on the drawings. For a surface which is to be subsequently plastered or pointed, the joints shall be squarely raked out to a depth of 15 mm, while the mortar is still green. The raked joints shall be well brushed to remove dust and loose particles and the surface shall be thoroughly cleaned and wetted. The mortar for finishing shall be prepared as per Clause 1304.\n\n# 1312.2 Jointing\n\nIn jointing, the face of the mortar shall be worked out while still green to give a finished surface flush with the face of the brick work. The faces of brick work shall be cleaned to remove any splashes of mortar during the course of raising the brick work.\n\n# 1312.3 Pointing\n\nPointing shall be carried out using mortar not leaner than 1:3 by volume of cement and sand or as shown on the drawing. The mortar shall be filled and pressed into the raked joints before giving the required finish. The pointing shall be ruled type for which it shall, while still green, be ruled along the centre with half round tools of such width as may be specified by the Engineer. The superfluous mortar shall then be taken off from the edges of the lines and the surface of the masonry shall be cleaned of all mortar. The work shall conform to IS:2212. Raised pointing which projects beyond the face of stone, brick or block shall be avoided.\n\n# 1312.4 Plastering\n\nPlastering shall be done where shown on the drawing. Superficial plastering may be done, if necessary, only in structures situated in fast flowing rivers or in severely aggressive environment. Plastering shall be started from top and worked down. All holes shall be properly filled in advance of the plastering, while the scaffolding is being taken down. Wooden screeds 75 mm wide and of the thickness of the plaster shall be fixed vertically 2.5 m to 4 m apart.\n\n504\n\nBrick Masonry\n# Section 1300\n\nto act as gauges and guides in applying the plaster. The mortar shall be laid on the wall between the screeds using the plasterer\u2019s float and pressing the mortar so that the raked joints are properly filled. The plaster shall then be finished off with a wooden straight edge reaching across the screeds. The straight edge shall be worked on the screeds with a small upward and sideways motion 50 mm to 75 mm at a time. Finally, the surface shall be finished off with a plasterer\u2019s wooden float. Metal floats shall not be used.\n\nWhen re-commencing plastering beyond the work suspended earlier, the edges of the old plaster shall be scraped, cleaned and wetted before plaster is applied to the adjacent areas. No portion of the surface shall be left unfinished for patching up at a later period. The plaster shall be finished true to plumb surface and to the proper degree of smoothness as directed by the Engineer.\n\nThe average thickness of plaster shall not be less than that specified. The minimum thickness over any portion of the surface shall not be less than the specified thickness by more than 3 mm. Any cracks which appear in the surface and all portions which sound hollow when tapped, or are found to be soft or otherwise defective, shall be cut in rectangular shape and re-done as directed by the Engineer.\n\n# 1312.5 Curing of Finishes\n\nCuring shall be commenced as soon as the mortar used for finishing has hardened sufficiently so as not to be damaged during curing. The curing shall be done for a period of at least 7 days, during which the finishing shall be suitably protected from all damages.\n\n# 1312.6 Scaffolding for Finishes\n\nStage scaffolding independent of the structure, shall be provided for the work of finishing.\n\n# 1313 CoPinG FoR WinG/RetuRn/PaRaPet Wall\n\nThis work shall consist of providing an architectural coping for wing/return/parapet walls. The material used shall be cement mortar 1:3 or as shown on the drawings prepared in accordance with Clause 1304. The cement mortar shall be laid evenly to an average thickness of 15 mm to the full width of the top of the wall and in a band of 150 mm depth along the top outer face of the walls.\n\n505\n\n\nSection 1300 Brick Masonry\n\n\n# 1314 Acceptance of Work\n\nAll work shall be true to lines and levels as indicated on the drawing or as directed by the Engineer, subject to tolerances as indicated in these specifications.\n\nMortar cubes shall be tested in accordance with IS:2250 for compressive strength, consistency of mortar and its water retentivity. The frequency of testing shall be one sample for every 2 cubic metres of mortar subject to a minimum 3 samples for a day\u2019s work.\n\nIn case of plaster finish, the minimum surface thickness shall not be less than the specified thickness by more than 3 mm.\n\n# 1315 Measurements for Payment\n\n# 1315.1\n\nAll brick work shall be measured in cubic metres. Any extra work done by the Contractor in excess of the specified dimensions, shall be ignored.\n\n# 1315.2\n\nIn arches, the length of arch shall be measured as the average of the lengths along the extrados and the intrados.\n\n# 1315.3\n\nThe work of plastering and pointing shall be measured in square metres of the surface treated.\n\n# 1315.4\n\nCoping shall be measured in linear metres.\n\n# 1316 Rate\n\n# 1316.1\n\nThe contract unit rate for brick work shall include the cost of all labour, materials, tools and plant, scaffolding and other expenses incidental to the satisfactory completion of the work, sampling, testing and supervision as described in these specifications and as shown on the drawings.\n\n# 1316.2\n\nThe contract unit rate for plastering shall include the cost of all labour, materials, tools and plant, scaffolding and all incidental expenses, sampling, testing and supervision, as described in these specifications.\n\n# 1316.3\n\nThe contract unit rate for pointing shall include erecting and removal of scaffolding, all labour, materials, and equipment incidental to completing the pointing, raking out joints, cleaning, wetting, filling with mortar, trowelling, pointing and watering, sampling and testing and supervision as described in these specifications.\n\n# 1316.4\n\nThe contract unit rate for coping shall include cost of all labour, materials, tools and plant, sampling and testing and supervision as described in these specifications.\n\n\n506\n\n\n# 1400\n\n# stone and ConCRete\n\n# BloCK MasonRY\n\nNO_CONTENT_HERE\n\nStone and Concrete Block Masonry\n# Section 1400\n\n# 1401 Description\n\nThis work shall consist of construction of structures with stones or concrete blocks jointed together by cement mortar in accordance with the details shown on the drawings and these specifications or as approved by the Engineer.\n\n# 1402 Materials\n\nAll materials to be used in stone and concrete block masonry, shall conform to Section 1000 of these Specifications, except cement mortar which shall conform to Clause 1304 of these Specifications.\n\n# 1403 Personnel\n\nOnly trained personnel shall be employed for construction and supervision.\n\n# 1404 Type of Masonry\n\nThe type of masonry used for structures shall be random rubble (coursed or uncoursed) or coursed rubble (first sort) or concrete block. For bridge work generally, coursed rubble masonry shall be used. The actual type of masonry used for different parts of structures shall be specified on the drawings. For facing work, ashlar masonry shall be used where indicated on the drawings.\n\n# 1405 Construction\n\n# 1405.1 Stone Masonry\n\n# 1405.1.1 General\n\nThe dressing of stone shall be as specified for individual type masonry work and it shall also conform to the general requirements of IS:1597 and requirement for dressing of stone covered in IS:1129. Other specific requirements are covered separately with respect to particular types of rubble stone work.\n\n# 1405.1.2 Laying\n\n# 1405.1.2.1\n\nThe masonry work shall be laid to lines, levels, curves and shapes as shown on the drawing. The height in each course shall be kept same and every stone shall be fine tooled on all beds, joints and faces, full and true. The exposed faces shall be gouged out, grooved, regulated and sunk or plain moulded as the case may be. The faces of each stone between the draft shall be left rough as the stone comes from the quarry, except where sacrificial layer is to be provided or plastering is resorted to in aggressive environment.\n\n# 1405.1.2.2\n\nStones shall be sufficiently wetted before laying to prevent absorption of water from mortar. Stratified stones shall be laid on their natural beds. All bed joints shall be normal to the direction of pressure coming on them.\n\nSection 1400\n# Stone and Concrete Block Masonry\n\nStones in the hearting shall be laid on their broadest faces so as to give better facility to fill the spaces between them.\n\nThe courses of the masonry shall ordinarily be pre-determined. They shall generally be of the same height. When there is to be variation in the height of courses, the larger courses are to be placed at lower levels, heights of courses decreasing gradually towards the top of the wall. The height of course shall not be less than 160 mm. placing loose mortar on the course and pouring water on it to fill the gaps in stones is not acceptable. Mortar shall be mixed thoroughly and poured in the joints in fluid state. No dry or hollow space shall be left anywhere in the masonry and each stone shall have all the embedded faces completely covered with mortar.\n\nIn tapered walls, the beds of the stones and the planes of course should be at right angles to the batter. In case of bridge piers with batter on both sides, the course shall be horizontal.\n\nThe bed which is to receive the stone, shall be cleaned, wetted and covered with a layer of fresh mortar. All stones shall be laid full in mortar both in bed and vertical joints and settled carefully in place with a wooden mallet immediately on placement and solidly embedded in mortar before it has set. Clean chips and spalls shall be wedged into the mortar joints and bed wherever necessary to avoid thick beds or joints of mortar. When the foundation masonry is laid directly on rock, the face stones of the first course shall be dressed to fit into rock snugly, when pressed down in the mortar bedding over the rock. No dry or hollow space shall be left anywhere in the masonry and each stone shall have all the embedded faces completely covered with mortar. For masonry works over rock, a levelling course of 150 mm thick M15 concrete, shall be laid over rock and then stone masonry work shall be laid without foundation concrete block.\n\nFace works and hearting shall be brought up evenly but the top of each course shall not be levelled by the use of flat chips.\n\nFor sharp corners specially in skew bridges, through stones shall be used in order to avoid spalling of corners.\n\nIn case any stone already set in mortar, is disturbed or the joints broken, it shall be taken out without disturbing the adjoining stones and joints. Dry mortar shall be thoroughly cleaned from the joints and stones and the stones reset in fresh mortar. When freshly laid, no attempt shall be made to slide one stone on top of another.\n\nShaping and dressing shall be done before the stone is laid in the work. No dressing or hammering, which will loosen the masonry, will be allowed after the stone is placed in position. All necessary chases for joggles, dowels and clamps, should be formed beforehand.\n\nSufficient transverse bonds shall be provided by the use of bond stone extending from the front to the back of the wall and in case of thick wall, from outside to the interior and vice versa. In the latter case, bond stones shall overlap each other in their arrangement.\n\nIn case headers are not available, precast headers of M15 concrete shall be used.

Staging shall be provided with an appropriately designed base plate resting on firm strata.\n\n519\n\nSection 1500\n# Formwork\n\n# 1504.2\n\nThe number of joints in the formwork shall be kept to a minimum by using large sized panels. The design shall provide for proper \u201csoldiers\u201d to facilitate alignment. All joints shall be leak proof and must be properly sealed. Use of PVC joint sealing tapes, foam rubber or PVC T-section, is essential to prevent leakage of grout.\n\n# 1504.3\n\nAs far as practicable, clamps shall be used to hold the forms together. Where use of nails is unavoidable, minimum number of nails shall be used and these shall be of the double-headed type. Alternatively, if the nails are of the normal type, they shall be left partially projecting without being driven to their full length, so that they can be withdrawn easily.\n\n# 1504.4\n\nUse of ties shall be restricted, as far as practicable. Wherever ties are used they shall be used with HDPE sheathing so that they can easily be removed. No parts prone to corrosion shall be left projecting or near the surface. The sheathing shall be grouted with cement mortar of the same strength as that of the structure.\n\n# 1504.5\n\nUnless otherwise specified, or directed, chamfers or fillets of size 25 mm x 25 mm shall be provided at all angles of the formwork to avoid sharp corners. The chamfers, beveled edges and mouldings shall be made in the formwork itself. Opening for fixtures and other fittings shall be provided in the shuttering as directed by the Engineer.\n\n# 1504.6\n\nShuttering for walls, sloping members and thin sections of considerable height shall be provided with temporary openings to permit inspection and cleaning out before placing of concrete.\n\n# 1504.7\n\nThe formwork shall be constructed with pre-camber to the soffit to allow for deflection of the formwork. This shall be in addition to the pre-camber for the permanent structure as shown on the drawings.\n\n# 1504.8\n\nWhere centering trusses or launching trusses are adopted for casting of superstructure, the joints of the centering trusses, whether welded, riveted or bolted shall be thoroughly checked periodically. Also, various members of the centering trusses should be periodically examined for proper alignment and unintended deformation before proceeding with the concreting. They shall also be periodically checked for any deterioration in quality due to steel corrosion. Launching truss, casting truss of span more than 40 m and travelling forms, shall be load tested before they are put to use.\n\n# 1504.9\n\nThe formwork shall be so made as to produce a finished concrete true to shape, line and levels and dimensions as shown on the drawings, subject to the tolerances specified in respective Sections of these specifications, or as directed by the Engineer.\n\n# 1504.10\n\nWhere metal forms are used, all bolts and rivets shall be countersunk and well ground to provide a smooth, plane surface. Where timber is used it shall be well seasoned, free from loose knots, projecting nails, splits or other defects that may mar the surface of concrete.\n\n# 1504.11\n\nForms shall be made sufficiently rigid by the use of ties and bracings to prevent any displacement or sagging between supports. They shall be strong enough to withstand all pressure, ramming and vibration during and after placing the concrete.\n\n520\n\nFormwork\n# Section 1500\n\nJacks or hard wood wedges where required shall be provided to make up any settlement in the formwork either before or during the placing of concrete.\n\n# 1504.12\n\nThe formwork shall ensure the correct final shape of the structure, with the calculated amount of positive or negative camber. The deformation of falsework, scaffolding or propping and the instantaneous or deferred deformation due to various causes arising in prestressed structures, shall be properly accounted for.\n\n# 1504.13\n\nSuitable camber shall be provided to horizontal members of structure, specially in long spans, to counteract the effects of deflection. The formwork shall be so fixed as to provide for such camber.\n\n# 1504.14\n\nThe formwork shall be coated with an approved release agent that will effectively prevent sticking and will not stain the concrete surface. Lubricating oils (machine oils) shall be prohibited for use as coating.\n\n# 1505\n\n# LINING OF FORMWORK\n\nThe formwork shall be lined with material approved by the Engineer so as to provide a smooth finish of uniform texture and appearance. This material shall leave no stain on the concrete and shall be so fixed to its backing as not to impart any blemishes. It shall be of the same type and obtained from only one source throughout for the construction of any one structure. The contractor shall make good any imperfections in the resulting finish as required by the Engineer. Internal ties and embedded metal parts shall be carefully detailed and their use shall be subject to the approval of the Engineer.\n\n# 1506\n\n# PRECAUTIONS\n\nThe following precautions shall be observed:\n\n1. It shall be ensured that any cut-outs or openings provided in any structural member to facilitate erection of formwork, are closed with the same grade of concrete as that of the structure, after formwork is removed.\n2. Provision for safe access to the formwork shall be made at all levels as required.\n3. Close watch shall be maintained to check for settlement of formwork during concreting and any settlement shall be promptly rectified.\n4. Natural ground shall be checked for bearing capacity and likely settlement before erection of the staging.\n5.

Release agents shall be applied strictly in accordance with the manufacturer\u2019s instructions and shall not be allowed to come in contact with any reinforcement or prestressing tendons and anchorages. Different release agents shall not be used in formwork for exposed concrete.\n\nBefore re-use of forms, the following actions shall be taken:\n\n1. The contact surfaces of the forms shall be cleaned carefully and dried before applying a release agent.\n2. It should be ensured that the release agent is appropriate to the surface to be coated. The same type and make of release agent shall be used throughout on similar formwork materials and different types should not be mixed.\n3. The form surfaces shall be evenly and thinly coated with release agent. The vertical surface shall be treated before horizontal surface and any excess wiped out.\n4. It shall be ensured that the reinforcement or the surface of the hardened concrete shall not come in contact with the release agent.\n\nAll forms shall be thoroughly cleaned immediately before concreting.\n\nThe Contractor shall give the Engineer due notice before placing any concrete in the forms to permit him to inspect and approve the formwork. However, such inspection shall not relieve the contractor of his responsibility for safety of formwork, men, machinery, materials and finish or tolerances of concrete.\n\n# 1508 ReMoVal oF FoRMWoRK\n\nThe scheme for removal of formwork (i.e. de-shuttering and de-centering) shall be planned in advance and furnished to the Engineer for scrutiny and approval. No formwork or any part thereof shall be removed without prior approval of the Engineer.\n\nThe formwork shall be so removed as not to cause any damage to concrete.

Prolonged time gap between assembling of reinforcement and casting of concrete, which may result in rust formation on the surface of the bars, shall not be permitted.\n2. Reinforcement bars shall be placed accurately in position as shown on the drawings. The bars, crossing one another shall be tied together at every intersection with binding wire (annealed), conforming to IS:280 to make the skeleton of the reinforcement rigid such that the reinforcement does not get displaced during placing of concrete, or any other operation. The diameter of binding wire shall not be less than 1 mm.\n3. Bars shall be kept in position usually by the following methods:\n\n1. In case of beam and slab construction, industrially produced polymer cover blocks of thickness equal to the specified cover, shall be placed between the bars and formwork, subject to satisfactory evidence that the polymer composition is not harmful to concrete and reinforcement. Cover blocks made of concrete may be permitted by the Engineer, provided they have the same strength and specification as those of the member.\n2. In case of dowels for columns and walls, the vertical reinforcement shall be kept in position by means of timber templates with slots cut in them accurately, or with cover blocks tied to the reinforcement. Timber templates shall be removed after the concreting has progressed up to a level just below their location.\n3. Layers of reinforcements shall be separated by spacer bars at approximately one metre intervals. The minimum diameter of\n\n\n\nSteel Reinforcement\n\n# Section 1600\n\nSpacer bars shall be 12 mm or equal to maximum size of main reinforcement or maximum size of coarse aggregate, whichever is greater. Horizontal reinforcement shall not be allowed to sag between supports.\n\nNecessary stays, blocks, metal chairs, spacers, metal hangers, supporting wires etc. or other subsidiary reinforcement shall be provided to fix the reinforcement firmly in its correct position.\n\nUse of pebbles, broken stone, metal pipe, brick, mortar or wooden blocks etc., as devices for positioning reinforcement shall not be permitted.\n\nBars coated with epoxy shall be placed on supports that do not damage the coating. Supports shall be installed in a manner such that planes of weakness are not created in hardened concrete. The coated reinforcing steel shall be held in place by use of plastic or plastic coated binding wires especially manufactured for the purpose. Refer Section 1000 of these Specifications for other requirements.\n\nPlacing and fixing of reinforcement shall be inspected and approved by the Engineer before concreting is commenced.\n\n# 1606 BaR sPliCes\n\n# 1606.1 lapping\n\nAll reinforcement shall be furnished in full lengths as indicated on the drawing. No splicing of bars, except where shown on the drawing, shall be permitted without approval of the Engineer. The lengths of the splice shall be as indicated on drawing or as approved by the Engineer. Where practicable, overlapping bars shall not touch each other, and shall be kept apart by 25 mm or 1.25 times the maximum size of coarse aggregate, whichever is greater. If this is not feasible, overlapping bars shall be bound with annealed steel binding wire not less than 1 mm diameter and twisted tight in such a manner as to maintain minimum clear cover to the reinforcement from the concrete surface. Lapped splices shall be staggered or located at points along the span where stresses are low.\n\n# 1606.2 Welding\n\n# 1606.2.1\n\nSplicing by welding of reinforcement will be permitted only if detailed on the drawing or approved by the Engineer. Weld shall develop an ultimate strength equal to or greater than that of the bars connected.\n\n# 1606.2.2\n\nWhile welding may be permitted for mild steel reinforcing bars conforming to IS:432, welding of deformed bars conforming to IS:1786 shall in general be prohibited.

Oxy-acetylene welding shall not be permissible. Any other process may be used subject to the approval of the Engineer and necessary additional requirements to ensure satisfactory joint performance. Precautions on overheating, choice of electrode, selection of correct current in arc welding etc., should be strictly observed.\n\nAll bars shall be butt welded except for smaller diameter bars (diameter of less than 20 mm) which may be lap welded. Single-V or Double-V butt joints may generally be used. For vertical bars single bevel or double bevel joints may be used.\n\nWelded joints shall be located well away from bends and shall be not less than twice the bar diameter away from a bend.\n\nGenerally, shop welding in controlled conditions is to be preferred, where feasible. Site welding where necessary shall, however, be permitted when the facilities, equipment, process, consumables, operators and welding procedure, are adequate to produce and maintain uniform quality at par with that attainable in shop welding, to the satisfaction of the Engineer.\n\nJoint welding procedures which are to be employed shall invariably be established by a procedure specification. All welders and welding operators to be employed shall be qualified by tests prescribed in IS:2751. Inspection of welds shall conform to IS:822 and destructive or non-destructive testing may be undertaken when deemed necessary. Joints with weld defects detected by visual inspection or dimensional check inspection, shall not be accepted.\n\nSuitable means shall be provided for holding the bars securely in position during welding. It must be ensured that no voids are left in welding. When welding is done in two or three stages, the surface shall be cleaned properly after each stage. Bars shall be cleaned of all loose scale, rust, grease, paint and other foreign matter before carrying out welding. Only competent and experienced welders shall be employed on the work with the approval of the Engineer. No welding shall be done on coated bars.\n\nM.S. electrodes used for welding shall conform to IS:814.\n\n530\n\nSteel Reinforcement\n# Section 1600\n\n# 1606.2.4\n\nWelded joints shall preferably be located at points where steel will not be subject to more than 75 percent of the maximum permissible stresses and welds so staggered that at any one section, not more than 20 percent of the bars are welded.\n\n# 1606.2.5\n\nSpecimens of welded pieces of reinforcement taken from the site, shall be tested.

In case such devices are permitted by the Engineer, they shall develop at least 125 percent of the characteristic strength of the reinforcement bar.\n\n# 1606.3.2\n\nanchorages\n\nBars may be anchored with approved patented mechanical anchorages as indicated on the drawing or as approved by the Engineer. The anchorages shall be connected to the reinforcing bar by the use of taper thread system. The anchorage shall be capable of developing the characteristic strength of reinforcement without damage to concrete and shall have sufficient diameter and width to develop adequate shear cone strength. The connection shall develop 125% of the characteristic strength of reinforcement bar.\n\n# 1607\n\n# testinG and aCCePtanCe\n\nThe material shall be tested in accordance with relevant IS specifications and necessary test certificates shall be furnished. Additional tests, if required, will be got carried out by the Contractor at his own cost.\n\nThe supply, fabrication and placing of reinforcement shall be in accordance with these Specifications and shall be as checked and accepted by the Engineer.\n\nManufacturer\u2019s test certificate regarding compliance with Indian Standards for each lot of steel, shall be obtained and submitted to the Engineer. If required by the Engineer, the Contractor shall carry out confirmatory tests in the presence of a person authorized by the Engineer. Cost of these tests shall be borne by the Contractor. The sampling and testing procedure shall be as laid down in IS:1786. If any test piece selected from a lot fails, no re-testing shall be done and the lot shall be rejected.\n\n# 1608\n\n# MeasuReMent FoR PaYMent\n\nReinforcement shall be measured in length including hooks, if any, separately for different diameters as actually used in work, excluding overlaps.

Where there is insufficient data to satisfy the above, the current margin for the initial design mix shall be taken as given in Table 1700-5:\n\n| Concrete Grade | Current Margin (MPa) | target Mean strength (MPa) |\n| -------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------- |\n| M 15           | 10                   | 25                         |\n| M 20           | 10                   | 30                         |\n| M 25           | 11                   | 36                         |\n| M 30           | 12                   | 42                         |\n| M 35           | 12                   | 47                         |\n| M 40           | 12                   | 52                         |\n| M 45           | 13                   | 58                         |\n| M 50           | 13                   | 63                         |\n| M 55           | 14                   | 69                         |\n| M 60           | 14                   | 74                         |\n| M 65           | 15                   | 80                         |\n| M 70           | 15                   | 85                         |\n| M 75           | 15                   | 90                         |\n| M 80           | 15                   | 95                         |\n| M 85           | 16                   | 101                        |\n| M 90           | 16                   | 106                        |\n\nThe initial current margin given in Table 1700-5 shall be used till sufficient data is available to determine the current margin as per Sub-Clause 1704.2.1(i).\n\n539\n\nSection 1700 Structural Concrete\n\n# 1704.2.2 Trial Mixes\n\nThe Contractor shall give notice to the Engineer to enable him to be present at the time of carrying out trial mixes and preliminary testing of the cubes. Prior to commencement of trial mix design, all materials forming constituents of proposed design mix should have been tested and approval obtained in writing from the Engineer. Based on test results of material, draft mix design calculation for all grades of concrete to be used in the works, shall be prepared after taking into account the provisions in the Contract Technical Specifications, Guidelines of IS:10262, IS:SP:23 and IRC:112 and submitted to the Engineer for approval.\n\nPrior to commencement of concreting, trial mix design shall be performed for all grades of concrete and trial mix which has been found successful, shall be submitted by the Contractor and approval obtained. During concreting with the approved trial mix design, if source of any constituents is changed, the mix design shall be revised and tested for satisfying the strength requirements.\n\nThe initial trial mixes shall be carried out in a laboratory approved by the Engineer. However, Engineer may permit the initial trial mixes to be prepared at the site laboratory of the Contractor, if a full fledged concrete laboratory has been established well before the start of construction, to his entire satisfaction. Sampling and testing procedures shall be in accordance with these Specifications.\n\nWhen the site laboratory is utilized for preparing initial mix design, the concrete production plant and means of transport employed to make the trial mixes shall be similar to those proposed to be used in the works.\n\nFor each trial mix, a set of six cubes shall be made from each of three consecutive batches for purposes of testing. Three cubes from each set of six shall be tested at an age of 28 days and three at an earlier age approved by the Engineer. The cubes shall be made, cured, stored, transported and tested in accordance with these Specifications. The mean strength of the nine cubes at 28 days shall exceed the specified characteristic strength by the current margin minus 3.5 MPa.\n\n# 1704.2.3 Control of strength of design Mixes\n\n# a) Adjustment to Mix Proportions\n\nAdjustment to mix proportions arrived at in the trial mixes, shall be made subject to the Engineer\u2019s approval, in order to minimize the variability of strength and to maintain the target mean strength. Such adjustments shall not be taken to imply any change in the current margin.\n\n# b) Change of Current Margin\n\nWhen required by the Engineer, the Contractor shall recalculate the current margin in accordance with Clause 1704.2.1. The recalculated\n\n540\n\nStructural Concrete\n\n# 1700\n\nvalue shall be adopted as directed by the Engineer, and it shall become the current margin for concrete produced thereafter.\n\n# c) Additional Trial Mixes\n\nIn case any changes are observed in the properties of fresh concrete and/or strength of hardened concrete on the basis of early age tests, additional mixes and tests shall be carried out during production, so as to control and bring the quality of concrete within acceptable limits. In case of any change in the source or properties of materials, the design of mix shall be established afresh.\n\n# 1704.3 Requirements of nominal Mix Concrete\n\nRequirements for nominal mix concrete unless otherwise specified shall be as given in table 1700-6.\n\n| Concrete Grade | Total Quantity of dry aggregate by Mass per 50 kg of Cement to be taken as the sum of individual Masses of Fine and Coarse aggregates (kg) | Proportion of Fine to Coarse aggregate (by Mass)      | Maximum Quantity of Water for 50 kg of Cement (litres) |    |\n| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | -- |\n| M 15           | 350                                                                                                                                        | Generally 1:2                                         | 25                                                     |    |\n| M 20           | 250                                                                                                                                        | subject to upper limit 1:1.5 and lower limit of 1:2.5 | 25                                                     | 22 |\n\n# 1704.4 additional Requirements\n\nConcrete shall meet any other requirements as specified on the drawing or as directed by the Engineer. The overall limits of deleterious substances in concrete shall be as follows:\n\n- Total acid soluble chloride content in the concrete mix expressed as chloride ions shall not exceed the following values by mass of cement.\n- Prestressed concrete: 0.10 percent\n- Reinforced concrete (in severe, very severe or extreme exposure condition): 0.20 percent\n- Reinforced concrete in moderate exposure condition: 0.30 percent\n\n541\n\nSection 1700\n# Structural Concrete\n\nb) The total water soluble sulphate content of the concrete mix expressed as SO\u2083, shall not exceed 4 percent by mass of cement in the mix.\n\nFor concrete made with Portland pozzolona cement, Portland blast furnace slag cement or mineral admixtures, the setting time and rate of gain of strength are different from those for concrete made with OPC alone. Such modified properties shall be taken into account while deciding the de-shuttering time, curing period, early age loading and time of prestressing. Additional cube samples may be required to be taken for verifying the concrete properties.\n\n# 1704.5 Suitability of Proposed Mix Proportions\n\nThe Contractor shall submit the following information for the Engineer\u2019s approval:\n\n- a) Nature and source of each material\n- b) Quantities of each material per cubic metre of fully compacted concrete\n- c) Either of the following:\n- i) Appropriate existing data as evidence of satisfactory previous performance for the target mean strength, current margin, consistency and water/cement ratio and any other additional requirement(s) as specified.\n- ii) Full details of tests on trial mixes.\n- d) Statement giving the proposed mix proportions for nominal mix concrete\n\nAny change in the source of material or in the mix proportions shall be subject to the Engineer\u2019s prior approval.\n\n# 1704.6 Checking of Mix Proportions and Water/Cement Ratio\n\nIn proportioning concrete, the quantity of both cement and aggregate shall be determined by weight. Where the weight of cement per bag as given by the manufacturer is accepted, a reasonable number of bags shall be weighed separately to check the net weight. Where cement is weighed from bulk stock at site and not by bag, it shall be weighed separately from the aggregates. Water shall either be measured by volume in calibrated tanks or weighed. All measuring equipment shall be maintained in a clean and serviceable condition. Their accuracy shall be periodically checked.\n\nThe specified water/cement ratio shall always be kept constant and at its correct value. To this end, moisture content in both fine and coarse aggregates shall be determined as frequently as possible, the frequency for a given job being determined by the Engineer according to the weather conditions. The amount of water to be added shall then be adjusted to compensate.\n\n542\n\nStructural Concrete                                                          Section 1700\n\nFor variations in the moisture content. For the determination of moisture content in the aggregates IS:2386 (Part III) shall be referred. Suitable adjustments shall also be made in the weight of aggregates to allow for their variation in weight due to variation in their moisture content.\n\n# 1704.7 Grading of aggregates for Pumped Concrete\n\nMaterials for pumped concrete shall be batched consistently and uniformly. Maximum size of aggregate shall not exceed one-third of the internal diameter of the pipe.\n\nThe grading of aggregates shall be continuous and shall have sufficient ultra fine materials (material finer than 0.25 mm). Proportion of fine aggregates passing through 0.25 mm shall be between 15 and 30 percent and that passing through 0.125 mm sieve shall not be less than 5 percent of the total volume of aggregate. Admixtures to increase workability can be added. When pumping long distances and in hot weather, set-retarding admixtures can be used. Fluid mixes can be pumped satisfactorily after adding plasticisers and super plaslicisers. Suitability of concrete shall be verified by trial mixes and by performing pumping test.\n\n# 1705 adMiXtuRes\n\n# 1705.1 Chemical admixtures\n\nChemical admixtures such as superplasticisers, or air entraining, water reducing, accelerating and retarding agents for concrete, may be used with the approval of the Engineer.\n\nAs the selection of an appropriate concrete admixture is an integral part of the mix design, the manufacturers shall recommend the use of any one of their products only after obtaining complete information of all the actual constituents of concrete as well as methodologies of manufacture, transportation and compaction of concrete proposed to be used in the work.\n\nAdmixtures/additives conforming to IS:9103 may be used subject to approval of the Engineer. However, admixtures/additives generating hydrogen or nitrogen and containing chlorides, nitrates, sulphides, sulphates or any other material likely to adversely affect the steel or concrete, shall not be permitted.\n\nThe general requirements for admixtures are given in Clause 1007 of these Specifications. Compatibility of the admixtures with the cement and any other pozzolona or hydraulic addition shall be ensured by for avoiding the following problems:\n\n- i) Requirement of large dosage of superplasticiser for achieving the desired workability,\n- ii) Excessive retardation of setting,\n\n543\n\n\n# Section 1700\n\n# Structural Concrete\n\n- Excessive entrainment of large air bubbles,\n- Unusually rapid stiffening of concrete,\n- Rapid loss of slump\n- Excessive segregation and bleeding.\n\n# 1705.2 Mineral admixtures\n\nFor use of mineral admixtures, refer Clauses 1714.1 and 1715.2.\n\n# 1706 Size of Coarse Aggregates\n\nThe size (maximum nominal) of coarse aggregates for concrete to be used in various components shall be as given in Table 1700-7.\n\n| Components                                                                                                             | Maximum nominal size of Coarse aggregate (mm) |\n| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |\n| I) RCC well curb                                                                                                       | 20                                            |\n| ii) RCC/PCC well steining                                                                                              | 40                                            |\n| iii) Well cap or Pile Cap Solid type piers and abutments                                                               | 40                                            |\n| iv) RCC work in girder, slabs wearing coat, kerb, approach slab, hollow piers and abutments, pier/abutment caps, piles | 20                                            |\n| v) PSC Work                                                                                                            | 20                                            |\n| vi) Any other item                                                                                                     | As specified by the Engineer                  |\n\nMaximum nominal size of aggregates shall also be restricted to the smaller of the following values:\n\n- a) 10 mm less than the minimum lateral clear distance between individual reinforcements\n- b) 10 mm less than the minimum clear cover to the reinforcement\n- c) One quarter of minimum thickness of member\n\nThe proportions of the various individual sizes of aggregates shall be so adjusted that the grading produces the densest mix and the grading curve corresponds to the maximum nominal size adopted for the concrete mix.\n\n\n\nStructural Concrete\n# Section 1700\n\n# 1707 eQuiPMent\n\nUnless specified otherwise, equipment for production, transportation and compaction of concrete shall be as under :\n\n# a) Production of Concrete :\n\n- i) For overall bridge length of less than 200 m \u2013 batch type concrete mixer, diesel or electric operated, with a minimum size of 200 litres automatic water measuring system and integral weigher (hydraulic/pneumatic type).\n- ii) For overall bridge length of 200 m or more \u2013 concrete batching and mixing plant fully automatic, with minimum capacity of 15 cum per hour.\n\nAll measuring devices of the equipment shall be maintained in a clean and serviceable condition.

The materials should be stock piled several hours, preferably a day before use. The grading of coarse and fine aggregate should be checked as frequently as possible to ensure that the specified grading is maintained.\n\nThe water/cement ratio shall always be maintained constant at its correct value. To this end, determination of moisture content in both fine and coarse aggregates shall be made as frequently as possible, depending on weather conditions. The amount of added water shall be adjusted to compensate for any observed variations in the moisture content. To allow for the variation in mass of aggregate due to variation in moisture content, suitable adjustment in the mass of aggregate, shall also be made. Accurate control shall be kept on the quantity of mixing water, which when specified, shall not be changed without approval.\n\n546\n\nStructural Concrete\n# Section 1700\n\n# 1708.3 Mixing Concrete\n\n# 1708.3.1 Mixing at site\n\nAll concrete shall be machine mixed. In order to ensure uniformity and good quality of concrete the ingredients shall be mixed in a power driven batch mixer with hopper and suitable weigh batching arrangement or in a central mix plant. Hand mixing shall not be permitted. The mixer or the plant shall be at an approved location considering the properties of the mixes and the transportation arrangements available with the Contractor. The mixer or the plant shall be approved by the Engineer.\n\nMixing shall be continued till materials are uniformly distributed, a uniform colour of the entire mass is obtained and each individual particle of the coarse aggregate shows complete coating of mortar containing its proportionate amount of cement. In no case shall mixing be done for less than 2 minutes. It shall be ensured that the mixers are not loaded above their rated capacities and are operated at a speed recommended by the manufacturer. When mineral admixtures are added at the mixing stage, their thorough and uniform blending with cement shall be ensured, if necessary by longer mixing time. The addition of water after the completion of the initial mixing operation, shall not be permitted.\n\nMixers which have been out of use for more than 30 minutes shall be thoroughly cleaned before putting in a new batch and also before changing from one type of cement to another.\n\n# 1708.3.2 Ready Mix Concrete\n\nUse of ready mix concrete proportioned and mixed off the project site and delivered to site in a freshly mixed and unhardened state conforming to IS:4926, shall be allowed with the approval of the Engineer.\n\n# 1708.4 transporting Concrete\n\nMixed concrete shall be transported from the place of mixing to the place of final deposit as rapidly as possible by methods which will prevent the segregation or loss of the ingredients. The method of transporting or placing of concrete shall be approved by the Engineer.\n\nConcrete shall be transported and placed as near as practicable to its final position so that no contamination, segregation or loss of its constituents materials take place.\n\nConcrete may be transported by transit mixers or properly designed buckets or by pumping. Transit mixers or other hauling equipment when used should be equipped with the means of discharge of concrete without segregation. During hot or cold weather, concrete shall be transported in deep containers. Other suitable methods to be reduce the loss of water by evaporation in hot weather and heat loss in cold weather may also be adopted.\n\n547\n\nSection 1700\n# Structural Concrete\n\nWhen concrete is conveyed by chute, the plant shall be of such size and design as to ensure practically continuous flow. Slope of the chute shall be so adjusted that the concrete flows without excessive quantity of water and without any segregation of its ingredients. The delivery end of the chute shall be as close as possible to the point of deposit. The chute shall be thoroughly flushed with water before and after each working period and the water used for this purpose shall be discharged outside the formwork.\n\nIn case concrete is to be transported by pumping, the fresh concrete should have adequate fluidity and cohesiveness to be pumpable. Proper concrete mix proportioning and initial trials should ensure this. The conduit shall be primed by pumping a batch of mortar through the line to lubricate it. Once the pumping is started, it shall not be interrupted, as concrete standing idle in the line is liable to cause plug. The operator shall ensure that some concrete is always there in the pump\u2019s receiving hopper during operation. The lines shall always be maintained clean and free of dents.\n\nPipelines from the pump to the placing area shall be laid with minimum bends. For large quantity placements, standby pumps shall be available. Suitable air release valves, shutoff valves etc. shall be provided as per site requirements. The pumping of priming mix i.e. rich mix of creamy consistency, to lubricate the concrete pump and pipelines, shall precede the pumping of concrete. Continuous pumping shall be done to the extent possible. After concreting, the pipelines and accessories shall be cleaned immediately. The pipes for pumping shall not be made of material which has adverse effect on concrete. Aluminium alloy pipelines shall not be used.\n\n# 1708.5 Placing of Concrete\n\nAll formwork and reinforcement contained in it shall be cleaned and made free from standing water, dust, snow or ice immediately before placing of concrete.\n\nNo concrete shall be placed in any part of the structure until the approval of the Engineer has been obtained. If concreting is not started within 24 hours of the approval being given, the approval shall have to be obtained again from the Engineer. Concreting shall proceed continuously over the area between the construction joints. Fresh concrete shall not be placed against concrete which has been in position for more than 30 minutes, unless a proper construction joint is formed.\n\nThe concrete shall be deposited as nearly as practicable in its original position to avoid re-handling. Methods of placing should be such as to preclude segregation. Care should be taken to avoid displacement of reinforcement or movement of formwork. To achieve this, concrete should be lowered vertically in the form and horizontal movement of concrete inside the forms should, as far as practicable, be minimised.\n\n548\n\nStructural Concrete\n# Section 1700\n\nThe concrete shall be placed and compacted before its initial setting so that it is amenable to compaction by vibration. The workability of concrete at the time of placement shall be adequate for the compaction equipment to be used. If there is considerable time gap between mixing and placing of concrete, as in the case of ready mixed concrete plants or off-site batching and mixing plants, concrete mix shall be designed to have appropriately higher workability at the time of discharge from the mixer, in order to compensate the loss of workability during transit. This is generally achieved by suitable chemical admixtures. Keeping these considerations in view, the general requirement for ready mixed concrete plants or off-site batching and mixing plants, is that concrete shall be discharged from the truck mixer within two hours of the time of loading. A longer period may be permitted if suitable retarding admixtures are used.\n\nIn wall forms, drop chutes attached to hoppers at the top should preferably be used to lower concrete to the bottom of the form. As a general guidance, the permissible free fall of concrete may not exceed 1.5 metres and under no circumstances shall it be more than 2 metres. When free fall of larger height is involved, self compacting concrete having adequate fluidity, cohesiveness and viscosity and which uniformly and completely fills every corner of the formwork by its own weight without segregation, shall be used.\n\nExcept where otherwise agreed to by the Engineer, concrete shall be deposited in horizontal layers to a compacted depth of not more than 450 mm when internal vibrators are used and not more than 300 mm in all other cases.\n\nConcrete when deposited shall have temperature of not less than 5\u00baC and preferably not more than 30\u00baC and in no case more than 40\u00baC. In case of site mixing, fresh concrete shall be placed and compacted in its final position within 30 minutes of its discharge from the mixer. When the concrete is carried in properly designed agitator operating continuously, the concrete shall be placed and compacted within 1 hour of the addition of cement to the mix and within 30 minutes of its discharge from the agitator. It may be necessary to add retarding admixtures to concrete, if trials show that the periods indicated above are unacceptable. In all such matters, the Engineer\u2019s decision shall be final.\n\n# 1708.6 Compaction of Concrete\n\nConcrete shall be thoroughly compacted by vibration or other means during placing and worked around the reinforcement, tendons or duct formers, embedded fixtures and into corners of the formwork to produce a dense homogeneous void-free mass having the required surface finish. When vibrators are used, vibration shall be done continuously during the placing of each batch of concrete until the expulsion of air has practically ceased and in a manner that does not promote segregation. Over-vibration shall be avoided to minimize the risk of forming a weak surface layer. When external vibrators are used, the design of formwork and disposition of vibrator shall be such as to ensure efficient compaction and to avoid surface blemishes. Vibrations shall not be applied through reinforcement and where\n\n549\n\nSection 1700\n# Structural Concrete\n\nVibrators of immersion type are used, contact with reinforcement and all inserts like ducts etc., shall be avoided.\n\nWhen internal vibrators are used, they shall be inserted vertically to the full depth of the layer being placed and ordinarily shall penetrate the layer below for a few centimetres. The vibrator should be kept in place until air bubbles cease escaping from the surface and then withdrawn slowly to ensure that no hole is left in the concrete, care being taken to see that it remains in continued operation while being withdrawn. The internal vibrators shall be inserted in an orderly manner and the distance between insertions should be about one and half times the radius of the area visibly affected by vibration. Additional vibrators in serviceable condition shall be kept at site so that they can be used in the event of breakdown.\n\nMechanical vibrators used shall comply with IS:2502, IS:2506, IS:2514 and IS:4656.\n\n# 1709 Construction Joints\n\nConstruction joints shall be avoided as far as possible. In no case shall the locations of such joints be changed or increased from those shown on the drawings except with the express approval of the Engineer.\n\nJoints should be positioned where they are readily accessible for preparation and concreting. Construction joints should be positioned to minimize the effects of the discontinuity of the durability, structural integrity and appearance of the structure. As far as possible, joints should be provided in non-aggressive zones, but if joints in aggressive zones cannot be avoided, they should be sealed. Joints should be located away from the regions of maximum stress caused by loading; particularly where shear and bond stresses are high.\n\nIn beams and slabs joints should not be near the supports. Construction joints between slabs and ribs in composite beams, shall be avoided. For box girders, there shall be no construction joint between the soffit and webs.\n\nJoints should be either vertical or horizontal. For a vertical construction joint, the lifts of concrete shall finish level or at right angles to the axis of the member. Concreting shall be continued right up to the joint.\n\nBefore resuming work at a construction joint when concrete has not yet fully hardened, all laitance shall be removed thoroughly. The surface shall be roughened, taking care to avoid dislodgement of coarse aggregates. Concrete shall be brushed with a stiff brush soon after casting, while the concrete has only slightly stiffened. If the concrete has partially hardened, it may be treated by wire brushing or with a high pressure water jet, followed by drying with an air jet, immediately before the new concrete is placed. Fully hardened concrete shall be treated with mechanical hand tools or grit blasting, taking care not to split or crack aggregate particles. The practice of first placing a layer of mortar or grout when concreting joints, shall\n\n550\n\nStructural Concrete\n# Section 1700\n\nbe avoided. The old surface shall be soaked with water, without leaving puddles, immediately before starting concreting. The new concrete shall be thoroughly compacted against it. Where there is likely to be a delay before placing the next concrete lift, protruding reinforcement shall be protected. In all cases, where construction joints are made, the joint surface shall not be contaminated with release agents, dust, or sprayed curing membrane and reinforcement shall be firmly fixed in position at the correct cover.\n\nThe sequence of concreting, striking of forms and positioning of construction joints for every individual structure, shall be decided well in advance of the commencement of work.\n\n# 1710 ConCRetinG undeR WateR\n\nWhen it is necessary to deposit concrete under water, the methods, equipment, materials and proportions of mix to be used, shall be got approved from the Engineer before any work is started.\n\nConcrete shall not be placed in water having a temperature below 5\u00baC. The temperature of the concrete, when deposited, shall not be less than 16\u00baC, nor more than 30\u00baC.\n\nCoffer dams or forms shall be sufficiently tight to ensure still water conditions, if practicable, and in any case to reduce the flow of water to less than 3 m per minute through the space into which concrete is to be deposited. Coffer dams or forms in still water shall be sufficiently tight to prevent loss of mortar through the joints in the walls. Pumping shall not be done while concrete is being placed, or until 24 hours thereafter. To minimise the formation of laitance, care shall be exercised not to disturb the concrete as far as possible while it is being deposited.\n\nAll under water concreting shall be carried out by tremie method only. The number and spacing of the tremies should be worked out to ensure proper concreting. However, it is necessary to have a minimum number of 2 tremies for any concreting operation, so that even if one of the tremies goes out of commission during concreting, the other one can be used to complete the work. The tremie concreting when started, should continue without interruption for the full height of the member being concreted. The capacity of the concrete production and placement equipment should be sufficient to enable the underwater concreting to be completed uninterrupted within the stipulated time.\n\nThe top section of the tremie shall have a hopper large enough to hold one full batch of the mix or the entire contents of the transporting bucket, as the case may be. The tremie pipe shall not be less than 200 mm in diameter and shall be large enough to allow a free flow of concrete and strong enough to withstand the external pressure of the water in which it is suspended, even if a partial vacuum develops inside the pipe. Preferably, flanged steel pipe of adequate strength shall be used. A separate lifting device shall be provided for each\n\n551\n\nSection 1700 Structural Concrete\nA tremie pipe with its hopper at the upper end. Unless the lower end of the pipe is equipped with an approved automatic check valve, the upper end of the pipe shall be plugged with a wadding of gunny sacking or other approved material before delivering the concrete to the tremie pipe through the hopper, so that when the concrete is forced down from the hopper to the pipe, it will force the plug (and along with it any water in the pipe) down the pipe and out of the bottom end, thus establishing a continuous stream of concrete. It will be necessary to raise the tremie slowly in order to allow a uniform flow of concrete. At all times after placing of concrete is started and until all the required quantity has been placed, the lower end of the tremie pipe shall be kept below the surface of the plastic concrete and shall not be taken out of concrete. This will cause the concrete to build up from below instead of flowing out over the surface and thus avoid formation of layers of laitance. It is advisable to use retarders or suitable superplasticizers to retard the setting time of concrete, which shall be established before the commencement of work.\n\n# 1711 Concreting in Extreme Weather\n\n# 1711.1 Concreting in Cold Weather\n\nWhere concrete is to be deposited at or near freezing temperature, precautions shall be taken to ensure that at the time of placing, it has a temperature of not less than 5\u00baC and that the temperature shall be maintained above 4\u00baC until the concrete has hardened. When necessary, concrete ingredients shall be heated before mixing but cement shall not be heated artificially other than by the heat transmitted to it from other ingredients of the concrete. Stock-piled aggregate may be heated by the use of dry heat or steam. Aggregates shall not be heated directly by gas or on sheet metal over fire. In general, the temperature of aggregates or water shall not exceed 65\u00baC. Salt or other chemicals shall not be used for the prevention of freezing. No frozen material or materials containing ice shall be used. All concrete damaged by frost shall be removed. Concrete exposed to freezing weather shall have entrained air and the water content of the mix shall not exceed 30 litres per 50 kg of cement. To counter slower setting of concrete, accelerators can be used with the approval of the Engineer. However, accelerators containing chloride shall not be used.\n\n# 1711.2 Concreting in Hot Weather\n\nWhen depositing concrete in hot weather, precautions shall be taken so that the temperature of wet concrete does not exceed 30\u00baC while placing. This shall be achieved by using chilled mixing water, using crushed ice as a part of mixing water, shading stock piles of aggregates from direct rays of the sun, sprinkling the stock piles of coarse aggregate with water to keep them moist, limiting temperature of cement below 30\u00baC at the time of use, starting curing before concrete dries out and restricting time of concreting as far as possible to early mornings and late evenings. When ice is used to cool mixing water, it will be considered as part of the water in design mix. Under no circumstances shall the mixing operation be considered complete until all ice in the mixing drum has melted. The Contractor will be required to state.\n\n\n\nStructural Concrete\n# Section 1700\n\nhis methodology for the Engineer\u2019s approval when temperatures of concrete are likely to exceed 30\u00baC during the work.\n\n# 1712 PRoteCtion and CuRinG\n\n# 1712.1 General\n\nConcreting operations shall not commence until adequate arrangements for concrete curing have been made by the Contractor. Curing and protection of concrete shall start immediately after compaction of the concrete.\n\nThe concrete shall be protected from:\n\n- a) Premature drying out particularly by solar radiation and wind\n- b) High internal thermal gradients\n- c) Leaching out by rain and flowing water\n- d) Rapid cooling during the first few days after placing\n- e) Low temperature or frost\n- f) Vibration and impact which may disrupt the concrete and interfere with its bond to the reinforcement.\n- g) Vibration caused by traffic including construction traffic.\n\nConcrete shall be protected, without allowing ingress of external water, by means of wet (not dripping) gunny bags, hessian etc. Once the concrete has attained some degree of hardening (approximate 12 hrs after mixing), moist curing shall commence and be continued through the requisite period. Where members are of considerable size and length, with high cement content, accelerated curing methods may be applied, as approved by the Engineer.\n\n# 1712.2 Water Curing\n\nWater for curing shall be as specified in section 1000 of these specifications. Sea water shall not be used for curing. Sea water shall not come into contact with concrete members before they have attained adequate strength.\n\nThe concrete should be kept constantly wet by ponding or covering or use of sprinklers/perforated pipes for a minimum period of 14 days after concreting, except in the case of concrete with rapid hardening cement, where it can be reduced to 5 days. Water should be applied on surfaces after the final set. Curing through watering shall not be done on green concrete. On formed surfaces, curing shall start immediately after the forms are stripped.\n\nThe concrete shall be kept constantly wet with a layer of sacking, canvas, hessian or similar absorbent material.\n\n553\n\nSection 1700\n# Structural Concrete\n\n# 1712.3 steam Curing\n\nWhere steam curing is adopted, it shall be ensured that it is done in suitable enclosure to contain the live steam in order to minimize moisture and heat losses. The initial application of the steam shall be after about four hours of placement of concrete to allow the initial set of the concrete to take place.\n\nWhere retarders are used, the waiting period before application of the steam shall be increased to about six hours.\n\nThe steam shall be at 100 percent relative humidity to prevent loss of moisture and to provide excess moisture for proper hydration of the cement. The application of steam shall not be directly on the concrete. Steam curing is applied in enclosures or tunnels through which concrete members are transported on a conveying system. Alternatively, portable enclosures or plastic covers are placed over precast members and steam is supplied to the enclosures.\n\nThe rate of increase or decrease of temperature should not be more than 10\u00baC to 20\u00baC per hour and the maximum temperature shall be about 70\u00baC. The maximum temperature shall be maintained until the concrete has attained the desired strength required at the end of steam curing period and shall be decided by prior trials. When steam curing is discontinued, the air temperature shall not drop at a rate exceeding 10\u00baC per hour, until a temperature of about 10\u00baC above the ambient temperature outside has been reached. Steam curing of concrete shall be followed by water curing for at least 7 days. The concrete shall not be exposed to temperatures below freezing for at least six days after curing.\n\n# 1712.4 Curing Compound\n\nMembrane forming curing compounds consisting of waxes, resins, chlorinated rubbers etc. may be permitted by the Engineer in special circumstances. Curing compounds shall not be used on any surface which requires further finishing to be applied. All construction joints shall be moist cured and no curing compound shall be permitted in locations where concrete surfaces are required to be bonded together.\n\nLiquid membrane forming compounds shall conform to ASTMC 309 and the curing efficiency shall be as per ASTMC 156.\n\nCuring compounds shall be continuously agitated during use. All concrete cured by this method shall receive two applications of the curing compound. The first coat shall be applied immediately after acceptance of concrete finish. If the surface is dry, the concrete shall be saturated with water and curing compound applied as soon as the surface film of water disappears. The second application shall be made after the first application has set. Placement in more than two coats may be required to prevent streaking. The membrane formed shall be stripped off after 14 days, when curing is complete. Impermeable membranes, such as sheet materials for curing concrete conforming to ASTM C 171 or polyethylene sheeting.\n\n554\n\nStructural Concrete                                                          Section 1700\n\nCovering closely the concrete surface, may also be used to provide effective barrier against evaporation.\n\n# 1713 FinisHinG\n\nImmediately after the removal of forms, exposed bars or bolts, if any, shall be cut inside the concrete member to a depth of at least 50 mm below the surface of the concrete and the resulting holes filled with cement mortar. All fins caused by form joints, all cavities produced by the removal of form ties and all other holes and depressions, honeycomb spots, broken edges or corners, and other defects, shall be thoroughly cleaned, saturated with water and carefully pointed and rendered true with mortar. The mortar shall be of cement and fine aggregate mixed in the proportions used in the grade of concrete that is being finished and of as dry a consistency as possible. Considerable pressure shall be applied in filling and pointing to ensure thorough filling in all voids. Surfaces which have been pointed shall be kept moist for a period of twenty four hours. Special pre-packaged proprietary mortars shall be used where appropriate or where specified in the drawing.\n\nAll construction and expansion joints in the completed work shall be left carefully tooled and free from any mortar and concrete. Expansion joint filler shall be left exposed for its full length with clean and true edges.\n\nImmediately on removal of forms, the concrete work shall be examined by the Engineer before any defects are made good. The work that has sagged or contains honeycombing to an extent detrimental to structural safety or architectural appearance of the member, shall be rejected. Surface defects of a minor nature may be accepted. On acceptance of such work, the same shall be rectified as directed by the Engineer.\n\n# 1714 ConCRete WitH Blended CeMents oR MineRal adMiXtuRes\n\n# 1714.1 Production of Concrete\n\nIn order to improve the durability of the concrete, use of blended cement or blending of mineral admixtures, is permitted. The maximum limit of flyash and ground granulated blast furnace slag in concrete, shall be as specified in Clause 1715.2. Blending at site shall be permitted only through a specific facility with complete automated process control to achieve the specified design quality or through RMC plants with similar facility.\n\n# 1714.2 Modi\ufb01ed Properties\n\nFor concrete made with Portland Pozzolona Cement, Portland Blast furnace slag cement or mineral admixtures, the setting time and rate of gain of strength are different from those of concrete made with OPC alone. Cognizance of such modified properties shall be taken.\n\n\n\nSection 1700\n# Structural Concrete\n\nin deciding de-shuttering time, initial time of prestressing, curing period and for early age loading.\n\n# 1714.3 Compatibility of Chemical admixtures\n\nCompatibility of chemical admixtures and superplasticizers with Portland Pozzolona cement, Portland blast furnace slag cement and mineral admixtures shall be ensured by trials outlined in Clause 1705.\n\n# 1714.4 additional tests\n\nIn addition to the strength tests prescribed in other Sections of these Specifications, the following additional tests are required to be carried out from considerations of durability.\n\n- i) Rapid Chloride Ion Permissibility Test\nRapid Chloride Ion permeability test on as per ASTM C 1202 at 56 days for extreme, very severe and severe conditions of exposure. The permissible value of Chloride-Ion permeability for extreme condition 800 Coulombs very severe condition 1200 coulombs and severe exposure condition 1500 coulombs.\n- ii) Water Permeability Test\nWater permeability test as per DIN: 1048 Part 5-1991 shall be carried out as described in Clause 1717.2.5.5.\n\n# 1715 HiGH PeRFoRManCe ConCRete\n\n# 1715.1 General\n\nHigh Performance Concrete shall be used where special performance requirements of high strength, high early strength, high workability, low permeability and high durability for severe service environments, are required. Production and use of such concrete in the field shall be carried out with high degree of uniformity between batches and very stringent quality control.\n\n# 1715.2 Materials\n\nCement, mineral admixtures, chemical admixtures, aggregates and water shall conform to section 1000 of these Specifications and this Section. Flyash when used, shall neither be less than 20 percent nor shall be greater than 35 percent of the total by mass of ordinary Portland cement and flyash and shall conform to grade-1 of IS:3812.\n\n556\n\nStructural Concrete\n\n# Section 1700\n\nGround granulated blast furnace (GGBS) slag when used, shall neither be less than 50 percent nor greater than 70 percent of the total mass of ordinary Portland cement and GGBS and shall conform to IS:12089.\n\nSilica fume conforming to IS:15388 shall be used.\n\nThe cement content of concrete inclusive of any mineral admixtures shall not be less than 380 kg/m\u00b3. The cement content excluding any mineral admixtures (Portland cement content alone) shall not exceed 450 kg/m\u00b3. The water/cement (cement plus all cementitious materials) ratio should generally not exceed 0.33 but in no case shall be more than 0.40.\n\n# 1715.3 Compatibility of admixtures\n\nCompatibility of the superplasticiser and admixtures with the cement and any other Pozzolanic or hydraulic dilutes shall be ensured by trials as outlined under Clause 1705.\n\n# 1715.4 Characteristic strength and target Mean strength\n\nCharacteristic strength and the initial target mean strength of concrete, shall be as given in table 1700-8.\n\nThe target mean strength shall be calculated as per Clause 1704.2 after obtaining data on standard deviation from sufficient samples.\n\n| Grade designation | Specified Characteristic Compressive strength at 28 days (MPa) | target Mean strength (MPa) |\n| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |\n| M 40              | 40                                                             | 52                         |\n| M 45              | 45                                                             | 58                         |\n| M 50              | 50                                                             | 63                         |\n| M 55              | 55                                                             | 69                         |\n| M 60              | 60                                                             | 74                         |\n| M 65              | 65                                                             | 80                         |\n| M 70              | 70                                                             | 85                         |\n| M 75              | 75                                                             | 90                         |\n| M 80              | 80                                                             | 95                         |\n| M85               | 85                                                             | 101                        |\n| M90               | 90                                                             | 106                        |\n\n557\n\nSection 1700\n# Structural Concrete\n\n# 1715.5 Workability and other Requirements\n\nWorkability, concrete mix design, field trial mixes, chloride and sulphate contents shall be as laid down in other Sections of these Specifications.\n\n# 1715.6 Mixing of Concrete\n\nThe concreting plant and means of transportation employed to make trial mixes and to transport them to representative distances shall be similar to the corresponding plant and transport to be used in the works. The optimum sequence of mixing of ingredients shall be established by trials. Mixing time may be longer than in normal grade concrete mixes. The temperature of concrete at the time of placement shall not exceed 25\u00b0C. The temperature of concrete at the mixing stage should be lower, to allow for rise in temperature during transport. When considerable distance of transport is involved, particular attention should be paid to ensure retention of slump as targeted for placement.\n\n# 1715.7 Prototype testing\n\nMock-up trials or prototype testing may be carried out to ensure that the concrete can be satisfactorily placed and compacted, taking into account the location of placement and provision of reinforcement, and required adjustments made in concrete mix design and/or detailing of reinforcement.\n\n# 1715.8 Curing of Concrete\n\nHigh performance concrete containing silica fume is more cohesive than normal mixes hence, there is a little or no bleeding and no bleed water to rise to the surface to offset water loss due to evaporation. Plastic shrinkage cracking is possible, if curing is not proper. Initial curing should commence soon after initial setting of concrete. Concrete should be covered with moist covers, opaque colour plastic sheets or suitable curing compound. Final moist curing should commence after final setting of concrete and continue for at least 14 days.\n\n# 1715.9 additional tests for Concrete\n\nApart from the strength tests prescribed in other Sections of these Specifications, the additional tests as specified under Clause 1714.3, shall also be carried out.\n\n# 1716 toleRanCes\n\nTolerances for dimensions/shape of various components shall be as indicated in these Specifications or shown on the drawings or as directed by the Engineer.\n\n# 1717 tests and standaRds oF aCCePtanCe\n\n# 1717.1\n\nConcrete shall conform to the surface finish and tolerance as prescribed in these Specifications for respective components.\n\n558\n\nStructural Concrete\n# Section 1700\n\n# 1717.2\n\nRandom sampling and lot by lot acceptance inspection, shall be made for the 28 days cube strength of concrete.\n\n# 1717.3\n\nConcrete under acceptance, shall be notionally divided into lots for the purpose of sampling before commencement of work. The basis of delimitation of lots shall be as follows:\n\n- No individual lot shall be more than 30 cu.m in volume\n- Different grades of mixes of concrete shall be divided into separate lots.\n- Concrete of a lot shall be used in the same identifiable component of the bridge.\n\n# 1717.4\n\n# sampling and testing\n\nConcrete for preparing 3 test cubes shall be taken from a batch of concrete at point of delivery for construction, according to procedure laid down in IS:1199.\n\nA random sampling procedure shall be adopted which ensures that each of the concrete batches forming the lot under acceptance inspection has equal chance of being chosen for taking cubes.\n\n150 mm cubes shall be made, cured and tested at the age of 28 days for compressive strength in accordance with IS:516. The 28 day test strength result for each cube shall form an item of the sample. Tests at other age shall also be performed, if specified.\n\nWhere automated batching plant/Ready Mixed Concrete Plant is located away from the place of use and the time gap between production and placement is more than the initial setting time or where any ingredients are added subsequent to mixing, separate sets of samples shall be collected and tested at batching plant and at location of placement. The results shall be compared and used to make suitable adjustment at batching plants so that properties of concrete at placement are as per the requirements.\n\n# 1717.5\n\n# test specimen and sample strength\n\nThree test specimens shall be made from each sample for testing at 28 days. Additional cubes may be required for various purposes such as to determine the strength of concrete at 7 days or for any other purpose.\n\nThe test strength of the sample shall be the average of the strength of 3 cubes. The individual variation should not be more than \u00b115 percent of the average. If variation is more, the test results of the sample are invalid.\n\n# 1717.6\n\n# Frequency\n\nThe minimum frequency of sampling of concrete of each grade shall be in accordance with Table 1700-9.\n\n559\n\nSection 1700 Structural Concrete\n\n| Quantity of Concrete in Work, m\u00b3 | no. of samples                                                         |\n| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 1 \u2013 5                            | 1                                                                      |\n| 6 \u2013 15                           | 2                                                                      |\n| 16 \u2013 30                          | 3                                                                      |\n| 31 \u2013 50                          | 4                                                                      |\n| 51 and above                     | 4 plus one additional sample for each additional 50 m\u00b3 or part thereof |\n\nAt least one sample shall be taken from each shift of work.\n\n# 1717.7 acceptance criteria\n\n# 1717.7.1 Compressive strength\n\n1. Cubes\nThe concrete shall be taken as having the specified compressive strength when both the following conditions are met:\n\n1. The mean strength determined from any group of four consecutive non-overlapping samples exceeds the specified characteristic compressive strength by 3 MPa.\n2. Strength of any sample is not less than the specified characteristic compressive strength minus 3 MPa.\n\nThe quantity of concrete represented by the test results include the batches from which the first and last samples were taken, together with all intervening batches.\n2. Cores\nWhen the concrete does not satisfy both the conditions given in (1) above, representative cores shall be extracted from the hardened concrete for compression test in accordance with the method described in IS:1199 and tested to establish whether the concrete satisfies the requirement of compressive strength.\n\nEvaluation of compressive strength by taking cores may also be done in case of doubt regarding the grade of concrete used either due to poor workmanship or based on results of cube strength tests.\n\nThe locations from which core samples are to be taken and their number shall be decided so as to be representative of the whole of the concrete under consideration. However, in no case shall fewer than three cores be tested. Cores shall be prepared and tested as described in\n\nStructural Concrete\n# Section 1700\n\nIS:516. Concrete in the member represented by a core test shall be considered acceptable if the average equivalent cube strength of the cores is equal to at least 85 percent of the cube strength of the grade of concrete specified for the corresponding age and no individual core has strength less than 75 percent of the specified strength.\n\n# 1717.7.2 Chloride and sulphate Content\n\nThe total chloride and sulphuric anhydride (SO\u2083) content of all the constituents of concrete as a percentage of mass of cement in the mix, shall not exceed the values given in this Section.\n\n# 1717.7.3 Density of Fresh Concrete\n\nWhere minimum density of fresh concrete is specified, the mean of any four consecutive non-overlapping samples shall not be less than the specified value and any individual sample result shall not be less than 97.5 percent of the specified value.\n\n# 1717.7.4 Density of Hardened Concrete\n\nWhere minimum density of hardened concrete is specified, the mean of any four consecutive non-overlapping samples shall not be less than the specified value and any individual sample result shall not be less than 97.5 percent of the specified value.\n\n# 1717.7.5 Permeability test\n\nWater permeability test as per DIN:1048 Part 5\u20131991 shall be carried out as described below:\n\n1. A cylindrical test specimen 150 mm dia and 160 mm high shall be prepared.\n2. After 28 days of curing, the test will be conducted between 28 and 35 days. The test specimen shall be fitted in a machine such that specimen can be subjected to a water pressure of up to 7 bars. A typical machine is shown in Appendix-1700/1.\n3. The concrete specimen shall be subjected to a water pressure of 0.5 N/mm\u00b2 from the top for a period of 3 days. The pressure shall be maintained constant throughout the test period. If the water penetrates through to the underside of the specimen, the test may be terminated and the specimen rejected as failed.\n4. After 3 days, the pressure shall be released and the sample shall be taken out. The specimen shall be split in the middle by compression applied on two round bars on opposite sides above and below.\n\n561\n\n\n\n\n# Section 1700\n\n# Structural Concrete\n\nv) When the split faces show signs of drying (after 5 to 10 minutes), the maximum depth of penetration in the direction of height shall be measured with the scale and extent of water penetration established.\n\nvi) The mean of maximum depth of penetration obtained from three specimens thus tested, shall be taken as the test result and it shall not exceed 25 mm.\n\n# 1717.7.6\n\nIf the concrete is not able to meet any of the standards of acceptance as prescribed, the effect of such deficiency on the structure shall be investigated by the Contractor as directed by the Engineer. The Engineer may accept the concrete as sub-standard work. Any additional work required by the Engineer for such acceptance, shall be carried out by the Contractor at his cost. In case the concrete is not found to be acceptable even after investigation, the Contractor shall remove the rejected concrete forthwith.\n\n# 1717.7.7\n\nWhen durability of concrete is desired the rapid chloride ion permeability test as stated under Clause 1714.3.1 shall also be performed in addition to above tests.\n\n# 1718\n\n# MeasuReMents FoR PaYMent\n\nStructural concrete shall be measured in cubic metres. In reinforced or prestressed concrete, the volume occupied by reinforcement or prestressing cables and sheathing shall not be deducted. The slab shall be measured as running continuously through and the beam as the portion below the slab.\n\n# 1719\n\n# Rate\n\nThe contract unit rate for structural concrete shall cover costs of all materials, labour, tools, plant and equipment required for mixing, transporting and placing in position, vibrating and compacting, finishing and curing as per this Section or as directed by the Engineer, including all incidental expenses, sampling and testing, quality assurance and supervision. Unless mentioned separately as an item in the contract, the contract unit rate for concrete shall also include the cost of providing, fixing and removing formwork required for concrete work as per section 1500 of these Specifications.\n\nIf the concrete is found to be acceptable by the Engineer as sub-standard work, the Contractor shall be subjected to reduction in his contact unit rate. For deficiency in compressive strength of concrete when accepted by the Engineer, the reduction in rate shall be applied as under:\n\n| Design Strength \u2013 Observed Strength | Percentage reduction in rate = | \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ x 100 |\n| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n|                                     | Design Strength                | 562                                                                  |\n\n\n\n# 1800\n\n# PRestRessinG\n\nNO_CONTENT_HERE\n\nPrestressing\n# Section 1800\n\n# 1801 Description\n\nThe work shall consist of imparting prestress to structural concrete members by stressing of wires/strands/tendons/cables with jacks of required capacity and holding them between appropriately designed anchorages fixed internally or externally to the members.\n\n# 1802 General\n\nThe work shall be carried out in accordance with the drawings and these Specifications or as approved by the Engineer.

In severe environment, cables shall be threaded after concreting. In such cases a temporary tendon shall be inserted in the sheathing or the sheathing shall be stiffened by other suitable method during concreting.\n\n# 1803.3 Anchorages\n\n# 1803.3.1\n\nPrestressing accessories like jacks, anchorages, wedges, block plates, etc. shall be procured from authorized manufacturers only. Anchorages shall conform to \u201cRecommendations for acceptance and application of prestressing systems\u201d published by FIB. The prestressing accessories shall be subjected to an acceptance test prior to their actual use on the work. Test certificates from a laboratory fully equipped to carry out the tests shall be furnished to the Engineer. Such test certificates shall not be more than 12 months old at the time of making the proposal for adoption of a particular system for the project. No damaged anchorages shall be used. Steel parts shall be protected from corrosion at all times. Threaded parts shall be protected by greased wrappings and tapped holes shall be protected by suitable plugs until used. The anchorage components shall be kept free from mortar and loose rust and any other deleterious coating.\n\n# 1802.3.2\n\nSwages of prestressing strand and button-heads of prestressing wire, where provided shall develop a strength of at least 95 percent of the specified breaking load of the strand or wire as the case may be.

Anchorage assemblies to be shipped shall also be similarly identified.\n\nAll samples submitted shall be representative of the lot to be furnished and in the case of wire or strand, shall be taken from the same master roll. The Contractor shall furnish samples of at least 5 m length selected from each lot for testing. Also, two anchorage assemblies, complete with distribution plates of each size or type to be used, shall be furnished along with short lengths of strands as required.\n\n# 1805 Workmanship\n\n# 1805.1 Cleaning\n\nTendons shall be free from loose rust, oil, grease, tar, paint, mud or any other deleterious substance.\n\nCleaning of the steel may be carried out by immersing in suitable solvent solutions, wire brushing or passing through a pressure box containing carborundum powder. However, the tendons shall not be brought to a polished condition.\n\n# 1805.2 Straightening\n\nHigh tensile steel wire and strand shall be supplied in coils of sufficiently large diameter, such that tendons shall retain their physical properties and shall be straight as they unwind from the coil. Tendons of any type that are damaged, kinked or bent shall not be used.\n\nThe packing of prestressing wire/strand shall be removed only just prior to forming of cable for placement. Suitable stands shall be provided to facilitate uncoiling of wires/strands without damage to steel. Care shall be taken to avoid the possibility of steel coming into contact with the ground.\n\n568\n\nPrestressing\n# Section 1800\n\n# 1805.3 Positioning\n\n# 1805.3.1 Post tensioning\n\nPrestressing tendons shall be accurately located and maintained in position, both vertically and horizontally, as per drawings.\n\nTendons shall be so arranged that they have a smooth profile without sudden bends or kinks.\n\nThe location of prestressed cables shall be such as to facilitate easy placement and vibration of concrete in between the tendons. High capacity tendons shall be used to reduce the number of cables thereby eliminating the necessity of grouping. The selected profiles of the tendons shall be such that their anchorages are not located in the top deck surface. Where two or more rows of cables have to be used, the cables shall be vertically in line to enable easy flow of concrete. The clear vertical and horizontal distance between any two cable ducts shall in no case be less than 50 mm or diameter of duct, whichever is greater, when grouping of cable is not involved. Where precast segments are used, the clear distance between cables shall be at least 150 mm.\n\nSheathing shall be placed in correct position and profile by providing suitable ladders and spacers. Such ladders may be provided at intervals of approximately 1.0 m. Sheathing shall be tied rigidly with such ladders/spacer bars, so that they do not get disturbed during concreting.\n\nThe method of supporting and fixing shall be such that profile of cables is not disturbed during vibrations, by pressure of wet concrete, by workmen or by construction traffic.\n\nSheathing in which the permanent tendon will not be in place during concreting shall have a temporary tendon inserted or shall be stiffened by some other method to the approval of the Engineer. The temporary tendon shall be pulled out by a special threading machine or other contrivance, before threading the permanent tendon.\n\nWhere possible, tendons shall be placed prior to stressing. Tendons shall be handled with care to avoid damage or contamination, to either the tendon or the sheathing. Any tendons which are damaged or contaminated shall be cleaned or replaced.\n\n# 1805.3.2 Pre-tensioning\n\nPrestressing steel shall be accurately located and maintained in position, both vertically and horizontally, as per drawings.\n\n569\n\nSection 1800\n# Prestressing\n\n# 1805.3.3\n\nEach anchorage device shall be set square to the line of action of the corresponding prestressing tendon and shall be positioned securely to prevent movement during concreting. The anchorage devices shall be cleaned to the satisfaction of the Engineer, prior to the placing of concrete. After concreting, any mortar or concrete which adheres to bearing or wedging surfaces, shall be removed immediately.\n\n# 1805.4\n\n# Cutting\n\nCutting and trimming of wires or strands shall be done by suitable mechanical or flame cutters. When a flame cutter is used, care shall be taken to ensure that the flame does not come in contact with other stressed steel. The flame cutting of wire or strand shall be carried out at least 75 mm beyond the point where the tendon will be gripped by the anchorage or jacks. In post tensioned members, the ends of prestressing steel projecting beyond the anchorages, shall be cut after the grout has set.\n\n# 1805.5\n\n# Protection of Prestressing steel\n\nPrestressing steel shall be continuously protected against corrosion, until grouted. The corrosion protector shall have no deleterious effect on the steel or concrete or on the bond strength of steel to concrete. Grouting shall conform to these Specifications or as directed by the Engineer. In the case of external prestressing, steel shall be encased in suitable polyethelene pipes before grouting.\n\n# 1805.6\n\n# sheathing duct Joints\n\n# 1805.6.1\n\n# General\n\nThe sheathing and all joints shall be water tight and shall withstand a pressure of 1.1 times the grouting pressure and maximum grouting head due to grout. Any temporary opening in the sheathing shall be satisfactorily plugged and all joints between sheathing and any other part of the prestressing system, shall be effectively sealed to prevent entry of mortar, dust, water or other deleterious matter. Sheathing shall be neatly fitted at joints without internal projection or reduction of diameter. Enlarged portions of the sheathing at couplings or anchorages shall be of sufficient length to provide for the extension of the tendons.\n\n570\n\n\n# Prestressing\n\n# Section 1800\n\nSpecial attention shall be paid to the junction at the anchorage end, where the sheathing must be tightly fitted on the protruding trumpet end of anchorage and thereafter sealed preferably with tape, to make it water-proof.\n\n# 1805.6.2 Coupling of Ms sheathing ducts\n\nFor major projects, the sheathing duct should preferably be manufactured at the project site utilizing appropriate machines. With such an arrangement, long lengths of sheathing ducts may be used with consequent reduction in the number of joints and couplers.\n\nWhere sheathing duct joints are unavoidable, they shall be made cement slurry tight by the use of corrugated threaded sleeve couplers, which can be tightly screwed on to the outer side of the sheathing ducts.\n\nThe length of the coupler should not be less than 150 mm but should be increased up to 200 mm wherever practicable. The joints between the end of coupler and duct shall be sealed with tape to prevent penetration of slurry during concreting. The couplers of adjacent ducts shall be staggered wherever practicable. As far as possible, couplers should not be located in curved zones. The corrugated sleeve couplers can be conveniently manufactured using the sheath making machine with the next higher size of die set.\n\nFor typical details of coupling refer Appendix 1800/1.\n\n# 1805.6.3 Coupling of HdPe sheathing ducts\n\nThe HDPE sheathing can be joined by any one of the following three methods.\n\n- a) Use of threaded sleeve couplers in the same manner as given for metallic sheathing.\n- b) Welding of two ends of HDPE sheathing using appropriate machine such as Roaster Machine or Mirror Machine.\n- c) Use of heat shrink couplers made of HDPE sleeves. The sleeves are integrated with the parent sheathing by hot process by using heating torch.\n\nFor typical details of coupling, refer Appendix 1800/I.\n\n# 1805.7 Grout Vents\n\nGrout vents of at least 20 mm diameter shall be provided at both ends of the sheathing and at all valleys and crests along its length. For cables longer than 50 m grout vents or drains may be provided at or near the lowest points. Additional vents shall also be provided along the length of sheathing such that the spacing of consecutive vents do not exceed 20 m.\n\n\n\nSection 1800\n# Prestressing\n\nof the grout vents shall be provided with a plug or similar device capable of withstanding a pressure of 1.0 MPa without leakage of water, air pressure or grout.\n\n# 1805.8 anchorages\n\nAll bearing surfaces of the anchorages shall be cleaned prior to concreting and tensioning. Anchor cones, blocks and plates shall be securely positioned and maintained during concreting such that the centre line of the duct passes axially through the anchorage assembly. The anchorages shall be recessed from the concrete surface by a minimum of 100 mm. After the prestressing operations are completed and prestressing wires/strands are cut, the surface shall be painted with two coats of epoxy of suitable formulation having a dry film thickness of 80 micron per coat and entire recess shall be filled with concrete or non-shirk/pre-packaged mortar of epoxy concrete.\n\n# 1806 suPeRVision\n\nPrestressing operation and grouting shall be entrusted only to specially trained and qualified personnel. All prestressing accessories shall be procured from authorized manufacturers with in-house testing facilities. The Contractor shall be required to engage specialized agencies who should also be entrusted with the total service contract for fabrication of cables, protection of cables during concreting, prestressing and grouting. Necessary certificates shall be accorded by such specialized agencies that the work has been carried out in accordance with prescribed specifications. In exceptional cases, the prestressing and grouting operations could be entrusted to the bridge Contractor himself, if the Employer is convinced that he is well experienced and has qualified personnel and sufficient track record to substantiate his performance in the particular system of prestressing being adopted.\n\n# 1807 tensioninG eQuiPMent\n\nAll tensioning equipment shall be procured from authorized manufacturers only and be approved by the Engineer prior to use. Where hydraulic jacks are used, they shall be power-driven unless otherwise approved by the Engineer. The tensioning equipment shall satisfy the following requirements:\n\n- The means of attachments of the prestressing steel to the jack or any other tensioning apparatus shall be safe and secure.\n- Where two or more wires/strands constitute a tendon, a single multi-pull stressing jack shall be used, which is capable of tensioning simultaneously all the wires/strands of the tendon. Suitable facilities for handling and attaching the multi-pull jack to the tendons shall be provided.\n\n572\n\nPrestressing\n# Section 1800\n\niii) The tensioning equipment shall be such that it can apply controlled total force gradually on the concrete without inducing dangerous secondary stresses in steel, anchorage or concrete.\n\niv) Means shall be provided for direct measurement of the force by use of dynamometers or pressure gauges fitted in the hydraulic system itself to determine the pressure in the jacks. Facilities shall also be provided for the linear measurement of the extension of prestressing steel to the nearest mm and of any slip of the gripping devices at transfer.\n\nAll dynamometers and pressure gauges including a master gauge shall be calibrated by an approved laboratory immediately prior to use and then at intervals not exceeding 3 months and the true force determined from the calibration curve.\n\nPressure gauges shall be concentric scale type gauges accurate to within two percent of their full capacity. The minimum nominal size of gauge shall be 100 mm. The gauge shall be so selected that when the tendon is stressed to 75 percent of its breaking load, the gauge is reading between 50 percent and 80 percent of its full capacity. Suitable safety devices shall be fitted to protect pressure gauges against sudden release of pressure.\n\nProvision shall be made for the attachment of the master gauge to be used as a check, whenever requested for by the Engineer.\n\nJack and pump shall be calibrated from an approved laboratory prior to use and then at intervals not exceeding three months.\n\n# 1808 Post Tensioning\n\nTensioning force shall be applied in gradual and steady steps, in such a manner that the applied tensions and elongations can be measured at all times. The sequence of stressing, applied tensions and elongations shall be in accordance with the approved drawing or as directed by the Engineer.\n\nIt shall be ensured that in no case, the load is applied to the concrete before it attains the strength specified on the drawing or as stipulated by the prestressing system supplier, whichever is more.\n\nAfter prestressing steel has been anchored, the force exerted by the tensioning equipment shall be decreased gradually and steadily so as to avoid shock to the prestressing steel or anchorage.\n\nThe tensioning force applied to any tendon shall be determined by direct reading of the pressure gauges or dynamometers and by comparison of the measured elongation with the calculated elongation. The calculated elongation shall be invariably adjusted with respect to the modulus of elasticity of steel for the particular lot as given by the manufacturer.\n\n573\n\nSection 1800\n# Prestressing\n\nThe difference between calculated and observed tension and elongation during prestressing operations shall be regulated as follows:\n\n1. If the calculated elongation is reached before the specified gauge pressure, continue tensioning till the specified gauge pressure is attained, provided the elongation does not exceed 1.05 times the calculated elongation. If 1.05 times the calculated elongation is reached before the specified gauge pressure is attained, stop stressing and inform the Engineer.\n2. If the calculated elongation has not been reached at the specified gauge pressure, continue tensioning by intervals of 5 kg/sq. cm until the calculated elongation is reached, provided the gauge pressure does not exceed 1.05 times the specified gauge pressure.\n3. If the elongation at 1.05 times the specified gauge pressure is less than 0.95 times the calculated elongation, the following measures must be taken, in succession, to determine the cause of this discrepancy:\n1. Check the correct functioning of the jack, pump and leads.\n2. De-tension the cable. Slide it in its duct to check that it is not blocked by mortar which has entered through holes in the sheath. Re-tension the cable, if free.\n3. Re-establish the modulus of elasticity of steel for the particular lot from an approved laboratory. If the required elongation is still not obtained, further finishing operations such as cutting or sealing, should not be undertaken without the approval of the Engineer.\n4. When stressing from one end only, the slip at the end remote from the jack, shall be accurately measured and an appropriate allowance made in the measured extension at the jacking end.\n\nA complete record of prestressing operations along with elongation and jack pressure data shall be maintained in the format given in Appendix 1800/II.\n\nThe number of stages of prestressing and grouting shall be kept to a minimum, preferably two in the case of simply supported girders.\n\n# 1809 GRouting oF PRestRessed tendons\n\nGrouting of prestressed tendons shall be carried out in accordance with provisions given in Appendix 1800/III. A record of grouting operations shall be maintained in the format given in Appendix 1800/IV.\n\n574\n\n# Prestressing\n\n# Section 1800\n\n# 1810 PRe-tensioninG\n\n# 1810.1 General\n\nThe planning and construction aspects of the tensioning bed, tensioning bench, abutments at location of anchorage, steam curing system, formwork of the concrete elements and arrangements for de-moulding, lifting, stacking and transportation of the pre-tensioned concrete elements are all specialised items of work and shall be entrusted to engineers specifically experienced in this type of work.\n\n# 1810.2 Concrete Mix Requirements\n\nMinimum cement content, maximum water cement ratio and other durability requirement shall be same as indicated in Table 1700-2 and Table 1700-3 of these Specifications except that minimum grade of concrete shall be M40.\n\n# 1810.3 Form Work\n\nAll sides, bottoms and header forms shall be of steel or any other suitable material. Forms shall be of sufficient thickness, with adequate external bracing and shall be stiffened and adequately anchored to withstand the forces due to placement and vibration of concrete. All joints of form work shall be leak proof. The bottom shutter shall have arrangement to permit longitudinal movement of girder concrete, which occurs while imparting prestress. Identifying marks shall be placed on the girders to indicate the correct orientation to ensure correct debonding locations, which may not be symmetrical, longitudinally.\n\n# 1810.4 Laying of Deflected Tendons\n\nFor long span pre-tensioned girders, deflected tendons shall be used instead of the conventional straight tendons. This requires the use of hold-up/hold-down devices at each deflected location, in order to hold the tendons in the desired profile and location. A hold-down device normally consists of rollers attached to a vertical rod, which passes through the bottom form and is anchored to the form substructure or foundation to resist the prestress force. The force which must be resisted by the hold-up/hold-down device, and therefore its size, depends on the number of deflected strands and the trajectory angles of the strands. The strand can be either tensioned after it is held in its deflected profile by means of hold-up/hold-down devices or it can be tensioned first and then brought into its deflected profile. The number of deflected strands and their angle directly influence the size and cost of the hold-up/hold-down devices.\n\n# 1810.5 Production and testing of Concrete\n\nA fully automated, computer-controlled batching plant shall be used. The batching plant shall\n\nSection 1800\n# Prestressing\n\nbe provided with moisture measuring and compensating devices and automatic pump for dispensing admixtures.\n\nSampling and testing of concrete shall be as per Section 1700 of these Specifications. Additional cubes shall be prepared to determine the concrete strength at the time of removal of forms and transfer of prestress. Adequate number of samples shall be taken for this purpose, which shall be cured in identical conditions to those of the concrete of respective girders.\n\n# 1810.6 Compaction, Removal of Form Work and Curing\n\nCompaction of concrete may be achieved through needle vibrators or form vibrators along with needle vibrators. For casting of precast beams, any of the two commonly known techniques of precasting viz. (i) Long Line method or (ii) Short Line method maybe used.\n\nThe girders shall not be moved from the casting location until stipulated strength requirements have been attained. The concrete shall have attained a minimum compressive strength of 20 MPa at the time of removal of forms. Curing of concrete may be achieved through water or steam followed by water curing. Approved curing compound may also be used.\n\nLongitudinal movement of the girders that takes place while releasing the prestress shall be suitably catered for. In case of long line method of precasting, adequate longitudinal gap shall be provided between girder ends during precasting, to accommodate projecting reinforcement and required length of the projecting strands.\n\n# 1810.7 stressing Bed for Pre-tensioning\n\nThe abutments and bed for pre-tensioning of tendons shall be designed to withstand the total tensioning force.\n\nA notice shall be displayed adjacent to the stressing bed showing the maximum tensioning force permitted.\n\nWhere concrete elements are cast and prestressed individually, the stressing bench or moulds shall be rigid enough to sustain the reaction of the prestressing force without distortion.\n\nIn the long line method of prestressing, sufficient locator plates should be distributed throughout the length of the bed to ensure that the wires are maintained in their proper position during concreting. The moulds shall be free to slide in the direction of their length and thus permit the transfer of the prestressing force to all the concrete elements along the whole line.\n\nSufficient space shall be left in between the ends of concrete elements to permit access for cutting the strands/wires after transfer. Hold-downs or deflectors shall be used for holding\n\n576\n\nPrestressing\n# Section 1800\n\nor deflecting the tendons in required position firmly. Deflectors which are in contact with the tendon shall have a diameter not less than the tendon or 15 mm, whichever is more.\n\nThe tensioning force required to be applied as stated on the drawings shall be the force remaining in the strands/wires after all strands/wires have been anchored to the abutments of the stressing bed and after the anchorage slip has already taken place. The tensioning force shall be determined by direct reading of the pressure gauges or dynamo-meters and by the measured elongation after slip.\n\nThe Contractor shall submit method of tensioning the tendons including the arrangement and layout of prestressing beds and all tendon deflection points, to the Engineer for approval before manufacture commences. The Contractor shall carry out trial stressing operations to establish the frictional resistance offered by the hold-downs and the slip during anchoring.\n\nDebonding of strands, wherever required, shall be carried out using HDPE debonding tubes. PVC tubes shall not be permitted for this purpose. After pre-tensioning the strands and before concreting, a recheck shall be made to ensure that the debonding tubes are placed at the intended locations. Both ends of debonding tubes shall be effectively sealed against ingress of any cement slurry using epoxy putty or any other suitable material.\n\nThe Contractor shall also submit calculation showing that the hold-downs have been designed and constructed to withstand concentrated loads resulting from the application of the tensioning force.\n\n# 1810.8 Pre-tensioning and de-tensioning operations\n\n# 1810.8.1 Pre-tensioning of strands\n\nPretensioning of strands may be carried out either using single-pull jack or multi-pull jack. In case of the former, it shall be ensured at each stage, that the strands are stressed symmetrically, so that the supporting system of the strands does not rotate or distort. This may be achieved through suitably designed moving trolley engaging the strands or any other suitable arrangement. Prestressing force shall be transferred to metallic spacer, trolley, etc. so that the force does not remain on the hydraulic system for long.\n\nIt is necessary to apply a small prestressing force, through hydraulic jacks to remove slackness of the strands. After removal of the slackness, the strands must be thoroughly examined to ensure correct alignment, including that of the debonding tubes. Reference marks for measuring elongation shall then be established and the full strand load is applied thereafter. Loads indicted by the gauging system shall control the tensioning, with elongation checked on every strand.\n\nSection 1800\n# Prestressing\n\nIt shall be ensured that the entire length of each strand between the grips is free of any defects. This is of particular importance while precasting girders using long line method entailing, longer pieces of strands between the grips.\n\nTransfer of prestress shall not proceed until the Engineer has approved the proposed method. Strands and deflection devices shall be released in such a pre-determined order that unacceptable tensile stresses are not induced in the concrete.\n\nPrior to transfer of the force to the units, all strands shall be tested for tightness and any loose strands shall be reported to the Engineer, who will decide whether the affected units should be rejected.\n\nThe Engineer may require that strands be marked at each end of any unit to allow measurement of the pull-in of the strands.\n\nThe sequence of transfer of prestressing force shall be done strictly as indicated in the drawings and ensuring that eccentricities of the prestressing force in the vertical and horizontal directions of the concrete element are minimum during the entire sequence.\n\nThe maximum slip of any tendon during transfer shall not exceed 3 mm for bottom strands and 5.5 mm for a top strands at any end of the concrete element. In case the slip exceeds above value, design of the member shall be got checked for the actual slip before acceptance.\n\n# 1810.8.2 de-tensioning of strands\n\nDetensioning, in order to impart the prestress shall be effected gradually, so that there is no significant loss of bond due to slippage of strands and consequent increase in the transmission length. For detensioning, the trolley is pulled outward by a small distance, in order to release the metallic spacers, before releasing the prestressing force. Even when the pretensioning is carried out through single-pull jack, the release of the force in all the strands, while imparting the prestress to the concrete, shall be simultaneous. It shall be ensured that, during this process, prestressing forces at any stage does not exceed 90 percent of 0.1 percent proof stress.\n\n# 1810.9 Cutting of strands\n\nCutting of strands shall be carried out carefully so as not to affect the untensioned reinforcement which is in their close proximity. Diamond bit saw shall be used to cut the strands. Strands and untensioned reinforcement shall be so arranged that the untensioned reinforcement and those strands which are required to be extended into the adjoining cast in-situ concrete, do not get affected during cutting operation.\n\nUnder factory conditions, flame cutting may be resorted to. Yellow flame should be used first to heat the strand without introducing undue stresses and then blue flame for the\n\n578\n\nPrestressing\n\n# Section 1800\n\nactual cutting. Heat cutting of strand shall be carried out symmetrically about the vertical axis of the members. One strand at a time on each side of the vertical axis for all girders in a long line shall be cut in the same manner. The above process shall be repeated till all the strands are cut. This will ensure gradual and uniform transfer of prestress to girders.\n\n# 1811 PRoteCtion oF ends\n\nThe exposed ends of the strands and the concrete surfaces of the ends of the units shall be wire brushed clean of all rust, loose mortar, grease and dirt.\n\nThe exposed ends of the strands and concrete surface within 50 mm of tendons shall be then abraded to provide a clean sound surface. An epoxy tar paint suitably formulated to give a dry film thickness of 80 micron per coat, shall then be immediately applied over the ends of the tendons unless otherwise directed.\n\nA second coat of paint shall be applied prior to the drying out of the first coat.\n\n# 1812 saFetY PReCautions duRinG tensioninG\n\nCare shall be taken during tensioning to ensure the safety of all persons in the vicinity. Jacks shall be secured in such a manner that they will remain in position, even if their grip on the strand is lost.\n\nNo person shall be allowed to stand behind the jacks or close to the line of the tendons while tensioning is in progress.\n\nThe operations of the jacks and measurement of the elongation shall be carried out in such a manner and that the safety of all concerned is ensured.\n\nA safety barrier shall be provided at both ends to prevent any tendon which might become loose, from recoiling unchecked.\n\nDuring actual tensioning operation, warning signs shall be displayed at both ends of the tendon.\n\nAfter prestressing, concrete shall not be drilled cut, chipped, or disturbed in anyway, without express approval of the Engineer.\n\nNo welding shall be permitted on or near strands nor shall any heat be applied to tendons. Any strand which has been affected by welding or weld spatter or heat shall be rejected.\n\n# 1813 suRFaCe PRePaRation\n\nAll surfaces, coming in contact with deck slab/ diaphragm shall be adequately prepared by green cutting, using surface retarders, by mechanical means to remove the laitance and\n\n579\n\nSection 1800\n\n# Prestressing\n\njust expose the aggregates. Usually, precast girders join the cast in-situ concrete of end diaphragms at the points of high shear stress. Therefore, it is extremely important to adequately prepare the end faces of the girders for effective bonding of the new concrete. This shall be done using suitable mechanical means (such as 100% hacking) to ensure that the course aggregates are just exposed. Surface retarders may also be used for this purpose.\n\n# 1814 tRansPoRtation stoRaGe and HandlinG oF PReCast GiRdeRs\n\nPrecast girders shall be transported in an upright position. Points of support and the direction of the reactions with respect to the girder shall approximately be the same during transportation, and storage as when the girder is placed in final position.\n\nMethod of transportation should be planned in such a way that the vehicle employed to transport the long girders can successfully negotiate the available road geometry. Adequate care shall be taken to ensure that the girder being transported does not topple due to unstable arrangement. For this purpose, height of the vehicle shall be kept as low as possible. This will also help in accommodating greater height of the system during transportation below existing bridges or through any other constraints. Girders should be transported only after 28 day concrete strength is achieved.\n\nWhen members are to be stacked, they shall be firmly supported at such bearing positions as will ensure the stresses induced in them are always less than the permissible design stresses. Further, inclined side supports shall be provided at the ends and along the length of a precast girder to prevent lateral movements or instability.\n\nCare shall be taken during storage, hoisting and handling of precast units to prevent them from being cracked or damaged. Units cracked or damaged by improper storing or handling shall be replaced by the Contractor at his cost.\n\nHandling of precast girders from precasting location to the bridge site requires careful operation. Lifting location shall be strictly as indicated on the construction drawings. Lifting devices generally consist of loops of prestressing strand or mild steel bars or any other suitable arrangement. If it is anticipated that embedded material for lifting devices will be cast into the face of the member that will be exposed to view or to corrosive materials in the completed structure, the depth of removal of the embedded material and the method of filling the resulting cavities shall be as shown on the construction drawings. The depth of removal shall not be less than the clear cover required to the reinforcing steel. The cavity so formed shall be suitably grouted for protecting the embedded metal. Also, the projecting reinforcement shall be suitably protected against corrosion.\n\n580\n\n\n# Prestressing\n\n# Section 1800\n\n# 1815 Tolerances\n\n# 1815.1 Permissible tolerances for structural unit\n\nThe dimensional tolerances for precast girders shall be as under:\n\n| Length                     | \u00b1 10 mm                |\n| -------------------------- | ---------------------- |\n| Flange width and thickness | \u00b1 5 mm                 |\n| Depth                      | \u00b1 5 mm                 |\n| Web thickness              | \u00b1 5 mm                 |\n| Minimum surface unevenness | 1.5 mm on 3 m template |\n\n# 1815.2 Tolerances for Prestressing strands\n\nPermissible tolerances for positional deviation of prestressing strands shall be as under:\n\n| Variation from the specified horizontal profile | 5 mm |\n| ----------------------------------------------- | ---- |\n| Variation from the specified vertical profile   | 5 mm |\n| Variation from the specified position in member | 3 mm |\n\n# 1816 Tests and Standards of Acceptance\n\nThe material shall be tested in accordance with these Specifications and shall meet the prescribed criteria and requirements.

The stud weld shall not show any sign of a crack or lack of fusion.\n\nThe studs whose welds have failed the tests given in (a) and (b) shall be replaced.\n\n# 1905.7.4 Inspection of Members\n\n# 1905.7.4.1 Inspection Requirement\n\nThe fabricated member/component made out of rolled and built-up section shall be checked for compliance of the tolerances given in Table 1900-2. Inspection of member/components for compliance with tolerances, and the check for deviations shall be made over the full length.\n\nDuring checking, the inspection requirement shall be indicated in such a manner that local surface irregularities do not influence the results.\n\n613\n\nSection 1900\n# Structural Steel\n\nFor plate, out-of-plane deviation shall be checked at right angle to the surface over the full area of plate.\n\nThe cross girder or cross frame deviation shall be checked over the middle third of its length between each pair of webs and at the end of member for cantilever.\n\nThe web of rolled beam or channel section shall be checked for out-of-plane deviation in a longitudinal direction over a length equal to the depth of the section.\n\nDuring inspection, the component/member shall not have any load or external restraint.\n\n# 1905.7.4.2 inspection stages\n\nThe stages of inspection to be carried out for compliance of tolerances shall include, but not be limited to, the following:\n\n- a) For completed parts, component/members - on completion of fabrication and before any subsequent operation such as surface preparation, painting, transportation, erection.\n- b) For webs of plate and box girder, longitudinal compression flange stiffeners in box girders and orthotropic decks and all web stiffeners at site joints - on completion of site joint.\n- c) For cross girders and frames, cantilevers in orthotropic decks and other parts in which deviations have apparently increased - on completion of site assembly.\n\nWhere, on checking member/component for out-of-plane or out-of-straightness at right angles to the plate surface, and any other instances, the deviation exceeds the tolerance, the maximum deviation shall be measured and recorded. The record shall be submitted to the Engineer who will determine whether the component/member may be accepted without rectification, accepted with rectification or rejected.\n\n# 1906 PaintinG\n\n# 1906.1 General\n\nUnless otherwise specified, all metal work shall be given approved shop coats as well as field coats of painting. The item of work shall include preparation of metal surfaces, application of protective covering and drying of the paint coatings along with all tools, scaffolding, labour and materials necessary.\n\nCoatings shall be applied only to dry surfaces and the coated surfaces shall not be exposed to rain or frost before they are dry. The coatings shall be applied to all surfaces excluding shear connectors and inner surfaces of fully sealed hollow sections. While coating adjacent surfaces, care shall be taken to ensure that primer is not applied on the shear connectors.\n\n614\n\nStructural Steel\n# Section 1900\n\n# 1906.1.1 types of Paints\n\ni) Ordinary Paints\n\nThese include paints based on drying oils, alkyd resin, modified alkyd resin, phenolic varnish epoxy, etc. Ordinary painting can generally be sub-divided into two types:\n\n- a) Primary Coats: This shall be applied immediately after the surface preparation and should have the properties of adhesion, corrosion inhibition and imperviousness to water and air.\n- b) Finishing Coats: This shall be applied over the primary coat and should have the properties of durability, abrasion resistance, aesthetic appearance and smooth finish.\n\nii) Chemical Resistant Paints\n\nThe more highly corrosion resistant paints can be divided into two main groups:\n\n- a) One pack paints (ready for use)\n- b) Two pack paints (mixed before use): The two pack paints shall be mixed together just before use since they remain workable thereafter only for a restricted period of time.\n\niii) Other types of paints as mentioned in Clause 1903.4 of this Section may also be used, subject to approval by the Engineer.\n\nAll paints shall conform to relevant IS Standards as appropriate.\n\n# 1906.1.2 Surfaces which are inaccessible for cleaning and painting after fabrication\n\nshall be painted as specified before being assembled for riveting. All rivets, bolts, nuts, washers etc., are to be thoroughly cleaned and dipped into boiling linseed oil conforming to IS:77. All machined surfaces are to be well coated with a mixture of white lead conforming to IS:34 and mutton tallow conforming to IS:887. In site painting, the whole of the steel work shall be given the second cover coat after final passing and after touching up the primer and cover coats, if damaged in transit.\n\n# 1906.1.3 Quality of Paint\n\nOnly paints which have been tested for the following qualities as per the specifications given in the relevant IS codes, should be used:\n\n- - Weight test (weight per 10 litre of paint thoroughly mixed)\n\n615\n\nSection 1900\n# Structural Steel\n\n- Drying time\n- Flexibility and adhesion\n- Consistency\n- Dry thickness and rate of consumption\n\n# 1906.1.4\n\nUnless otherwise specified, all painting and protective coating work shall be done in accordance with IS:1477 (Part I).\n\n# 1906.2\n\n# Surface Preparation\n\nSteel surface to be painted either at the fabricating shop or at the site of work shall be prepared in a thorough manner with a view to ensuring complete removal of mill scale by one of the following processes as agreed to between the fabricator and the Engineer:\n\n- a) Dry or wet grit/sand blasting\n- b) Pickling which should be restricted to single plates, bars and sections\n- c) Flame cleaning\n\nPrimary coat shall be applied as soon as practicable after cleaning and in case of flame cleaning, while the metal is still warm. All slag from welds shall be removed before painting. Surfaces shall be maintained dry and free from dirt and oil. Work out of doors in frosty or humid weather shall be avoided.\n\n# 1906.3\n\n# Coatings\n\nPrime coat to be used shall conform to the specification of primers approved by the Engineer. Metal coatings shall be considered as prime coats. Primer shall be applied to the blast cleaned surface before any deterioration of the surface is visible. In any case, the surface shall receive one coat of primer within 4 hours of abrasive blast cleaning.\n\nAll coats shall be compatible with each other. When metal based coatings are used, the undercoat shall be compatible with the concerned metal base. The undercoat and finishing coat shall preferably be from the same manufacturer. Successive coats of paints shall be of different shades or colours and each shall be allowed to dry thoroughly before the next is applied. Particular care shall be taken with the priming and painting of edges, corners, welds and rivets.\n\nTypical guidelines for epoxy based paints and the conventional painting system for bridge girders as given below, may be complied with:\n\n- a) Epoxy Based Painting\n- i) Surface preparation: Remove oil/grease by use of petroleum hydrocarbon solution (IS:1745) and grit blasting to near white metal surface.\n- ii) Paint system: 2 coats of epoxy zinc phosphate primer = 60 micron; Total 5 coats = 200 micron\n\nStructural Steel\n\n# Section 1900\n\n# b) Conventional Painting system for areas where corrosion is not severe\n\nPriming Coat :\n\n- One coat of ready mixed, red lead primer conforming to IS:102\n- or\n- One coat of ready mixed zinc chrome primer conforming to IS:104 followed by one coat of ready mixed red oxide zinc chrome primer conforming to IS:2074\n- or\n- Two coats of red oxide zinc chrome primer conforming to IS:2074.\n\nFinishing Coats :\n\nTwo cover coats of red oxide paint conforming to IS:123 or any other approved paint shall be applied over the primer coat. One coat shall be applied before the fabricated steel work leaves the shop. After the steel work is erected at site, the second coat shall be given after touching up the primer and the cover coats, if damaged in transit.\n\n# c) Conventional Painting system for areas where corrosion is severe\n\nPriming Coat :\n\n- Two coats of ready mixed red lead primer conforming to IS:102\n- or\n- One coat of ready mixed zinc chrome primer conforming to IS:104 followed by one coat of ready mixed zinc chrome primer conforming to IS:2074.\n\nFinishing Coats :\n\nTwo coats of aluminium paint conforming to IS:2339 shall be applied over the primer coat. One coat shall be applied before the fabricated steel work leaves the shop. After the steel work is erected at site, the second coat shall be given after touching up the primer and the cover coats, if damaged in transit.\n\n# 1906.4 Painting in the shop\n\nAll fabricated steel shall be painted in the shop after inspection and acceptance with at least one priming coat, unless the exposed surfaces are subsequently to be cleaned at site or are metal coated. No primer shall be applied to galvanised surfaces.\n\nShop contact surfaces, if specifically required to be painted, shall be brought together while the paint is still wet.\n\nField contact surfaces and surfaces to be in contact with cement, shall be painted with primer only. No paint shall be applied within 50 mm of design location of field welds. Paint shall be completely dry before loading and transporting of the fabricated steel work to site.\n\nSurfaces not in contact but inaccessible after shop assembly shall receive the full specified protective treatment before assembly.\n\n617\n\nSection 1900\n# Structural Steel\n\nWhere surfaces are to be welded, the steel shall not be painted or metal coated within a suitable distance from any edges to be welded, if the specified paint or metal coating would be harmful to welders or is likely to impair the quality of site welds. Exposed machined surfaces shall be adequately protected.\n\n# 1906.5 Painting at site\n\nSurfaces which will be inaccessible after site assembly shall receive the full specified protective treatment before assembly. Surfaces which will be in contact after site assembly shall receive a coat of paint (in addition to any shop priming) and shall be brought together while the paint is still wet. Damaged or deteriorated paint surfaces shall be first made good with the same type of coat as the shop coat. Where steel has received a metal coating in the shop, this coating shall be completed on site so as to be continuous over any welds, bolts and site rivets. Specified protective treatment shall be completed after erection.\n\n# 1906.6 Methods of application\n\nThe methods of application of all paint coatings shall be in accordance with the manufacturer\u2019s written recommendation and shall be as approved by the Engineer. Spray painting may be permitted provided it will not cause inconvenience to the public and is appropriate to the type of structure being coated. Areas inaccessible for painting and areas shaded for spray application, shall be coated first by brushing. Oil based red lead primers must be applied by brush only, taking care to work into all corners and crevices. The primer, intermediate and finishing coats shall all be applied so as to provide smooth coatings of uniform thickness. Wrinkled or blistered coatings or coatings with pinholes, sags, lumps or other blemishes shall not be accepted. Where the Engineer so directs, the coating shall be removed by abrasive blast cleaning and replaced by the Contractor at his own cost.\n\n# 1906.7 Protective Coatings in different environments\n\nSince the severity of corrosion depends upon atmospheric conditions and these vary enormously, there is no single protective system or method of application that is suitable for every situation.\n\n| Environmental Conditions | Type of Coating | Approximate Life to First Maintenance |\n| ------------------------ | --------------- | ------------------------------------- |\n| Condition 1              | Coating Type A  | 5 years                               |\n| Condition 2              | Coating Type B  | 10 years                              |\n| Condition 3              | Coating Type C  | 15 years                              |\n\n# 1907 tests and standards of acceptance\n\nThe materials shall be tested in accordance with relevant IS Specifications and necessary.\n\n618\n\nStructural Steel\n\n# Section 1900\n\nTest certificates shall be furnished.

Cutting shall produce a smooth surface without injurious heating of the elastomer.\n2. Bearing with steel laminates shall be moulded as a single unit in a mould and vulcanised under heat and pressure. Moulding of elements\n\n636\n\n# Bearings\n\n# Section 2000\n\nin separate units and subsequent bonding as well as cutting from large sized cast, shall not be permitted.\n\n1. The moulds used shall have standard surface finish adequate to produce bearings free from any surface blemishes.\n2. Steel plates for laminates shall be sand/grit blasted, clean of all mill scales and shall be free from all contaminants prior to bonding by vulcanization. Rusted plates with pitting shall not be used. The plates shall be rounded so as to be free of sharp edges.\n3. Bonding shall be carried out during vulcanisation using suitable bonding agent for bonding of elastomer to steel such that the bond peel strength is at least 7 N/mm width when tested in accordance with IS:3400 Part XIV method A.\n4. Spacers used in mould to ensure cover and location of laminates shall be of minimum size and number practicable. Any hole at surface or in edge cover shall be filled in subsequently.\n5. Care shall be taken to ensure uniform vulcanizing conditions and homogeneity of elastomer through the surface and body of bearings.\n6. The vulcanizing equipment/press shall be such that between the platens of the press, the pressure and temperature are uniform and capable of being maintained at constant values as required for effecting a uniform vulcanization of the bearing.\n7. The moulding dies utilized for manufacturing the bearings shall be so set inside the platen of the press that the pressure developed during vulcanization of the product is evenly distributed and the thickness maintained at all places are within acceptable tolerance limits taking into consideration the expansion/shrinkage allowance of vulcanizate (the product of vulcanization).\n8. The raw compound which is introduced inside the metal dies for vulcanization shall be accurately weighed each time and shall be of sufficient quantity to ensure proper flow of material to every part of the die so that a homogeneous and compact bearing is produced without any sign of sponginess or deficiency of material at any place.\n9. Before the rubber mix of any batch is used for producing vulcanized bearings, test pieces in the form of standard slab and buttons shall be prepared in accordance with prescribed standards and salient properties tested and recorded regularly against each batch of production to monitor the quality of the products.\n\nSection 2000 Bearings\n\nxii) Bearings of similar size to be used in a particular bridge project shall be produced by identical process and in one lot as far as practicable. Phased production may be resorted to only when the total number of bearings is large.\n\n# 2005.3 Manufacturing tolerances\n\nThe bearings shall be fabricated/manufactured with the tolerances specified in Table 2000-3. Tolerances of thickness of individual layer of elastomer, dimension of laminates, and flatness of laminates are primarily meant for quality control during production. In order to measure thickness of individual layer of elastomer, dimension of laminates and flatness of laminates of a finished bearing, it is essential to cut the bearing, which may be done if agreed upon between the manufacturer and the buyer.\n\n| Items                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Tolerances         |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------ |\n| 1) Overall linear plan dimensions                                                                                                                                                                                                          | -3 mm, +6 mm       |\n| 2) Total mean bearing thickness                                                                                                                                                                                                            | -2.5%, +5%         |\n| (The mean thickness is the arithmetic average of the thickness measured at five points on the major surface as indicated for various shaped bearings: Rectangular : corners and centre, Circular : corners of inscribed square and centre) |                    |\n| 3) Parallelism                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                    |\n| a) Of top surface of bearing with respect to the bottom surface as datum                                                                                                                                                                   | 1 in 200           |\n| b) Of one side surface with respect to the other as datum                                                                                                                                                                                  | 1 in 100           |\n| 4) Thickness of individual layer of elastomer                                                                                                                                                                                              |                    |\n| a) Inner layer of elastomer                                                                                                                                                                                                                | \u00b112% (max of 2 mm) |\n| b) Outer layer of elastomer                                                                                                                                                                                                                | +20% (max of 1 mm) |\n| c) Side cover                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | -0 mm, +3 mm       |\n| 5) Dimension of laminates                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                    |\n| a) Plan dimensions of laminates                                                                                                                                                                                                            | -3 mm, +0          |\n| b) Thickness of laminate                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | \u00b110%               |\n| c) Parallelism of laminate with respect to bearing base as datum                                                                                                                                                                           | 1 in 100           |\n| (with respect to diameter for plates circular in plan and shorter side for plates rectangular in plan)                                                                                                                                     |                    |\n\n638\n\nBearings\n# Section 2000\n\n# 6) Flatness\n\nFlatness shall be assessed by placing a straightedge along the diagonal or diameter.

The test facilities and their operation shall be open to inspection by the Engineer on demand.\n\nAll acceptance and process control tests shall be conducted at the manufacturer\u2019s plant. Cost of all materials, equipment and labour shall be borne by the manufacturer unless otherwise specified or specially agreed to between the manufacturer and Engineer.\n\nA testing programme shall be submitted by the manufacturer to the Engineer and his approval obtained before commencement of acceptance testing.\n\nAny acceptance testing delayed 180 days beyond the date of production shall require special approval of the Engineer and modified acceptance specification, if deemed necessary by him.\n\nAll acceptance testing shall be conducted by the Inspector with the aid of the manufacturer\u2019s personnel having adequate expertise and experience in rubber testing, working under the supervision of the Inspector and to his complete satisfaction.\n\nInspection and acceptance shall be carried out lot by lot.\n\n# 2005.4.1 acceptance lot\n\nA lot under acceptance shall comprise all bearings, including the pair of extra test bearings where applicable, of equal or near equal size produced under identical conditions of manufacture, to be supplied for a particular project.\n\nThe size and composition of acceptance lot shall be got approved by the Engineer.\n\n639\n\nSection 2000 Bearings\n\nFor the purpose of grading levels of acceptance testing, a lot size of 24 or larger number of bearings shall be defined as a \u2018large lot\u2019, while a lot size of less than 24 number of bearings shall be defined as a \u2018small lot\u2019.\n\nWhen the number of bearings of equal or near equal size for a single bridge project is large and phased production and acceptance is permitted, the number of bearings supplied in any single phase of supply shall comprise a lot under acceptance. When such phased supply is made, each such lot shall be considered as a large lot for the purpose of acceptance testing.\n\n# 2005.4.2 levels of acceptance testing\n\nThe following two Levels of acceptance testing shall be adopted, depending on lot size:\n\nAcceptance testing Level 1 is a higher level of inspection and testing and shall be applicable to large lots only, unless otherwise specified. This shall involve manufacture of two extra bearings for each lot to be used as test bearings and eventually consumed in destructive testing.\n\nAcceptance testing Level 2 shall be applicable to small lots only, for which one extra bearing shall be manufactured and shall not involve destructive testing of finished bearing. Out of the lot, one bearing shall be selected at random for carrying out material tests. This bearing shall be excluded from the lot accepted.\n\nAcceptance testing Level 1 may be specified for small lots also at the sole discretion of the Engineer taking into account the special importance of a bridge project. The cost of extra bearings, in such cases shall be borne by the user, while the cost of all other materials, equipment and testing shall be borne by manufacturer.\n\n# 2005.4.3 testing\n\nAcceptance testing shall comprise general inspection, test on specially moulded test pieces and test on complete bearings or sections for measurement of various quality characteristics detailed below:\n\n# 2005.4.3.1 acceptance testing level 1\n\nGeneral inspection\n\n1. All bearings of the lot shall be visually inspected for absence of any defects in surface finish, shape, hardness or any other discernible superficial defects.\n2. All bearings of the lot shall be checked for tolerances for overall dimensions, mean bearing thickness, parallelism of bearing surfaces and flatness of load bearing surfaces as specified in Table 2000-3.\n\n640\n\nBearings\n# Section 2000\n\niii) The test shall be carried out on all bearings as part of the standard production process. The temperature of the room in which the bearings are tested shall not vary more than 10 \u00baC. The main objective of this test is to eliminate poorly made bearings by visual inspection in a quick and efficient way. All bearings of the lot shall be subjected to an axial load to correspond to the design load at serviceability limit state while visual examination is made to check for discernible defects like:\n\n- Misalignment of reinforcing plates\n- Poor bond at laminate/steel interface\n- Variation in elastomer layer thickness\n- Any surface defects developed during testing\n\niv) During acceptance testing, complete test data shall be furnished by the manufacturer and one bearing per lot shall be selected at random and the same test shall be repeated. The bearings shall then be visually inspected for defects and the stiffness shall also be measured.\n\nv) During the test, the deflection between 30 percent and 100 percent of the maximum load for the application shall be recorded and used to check the consistency of the stiffness value. Variation in stiffness of any individual bearing from the mean of the measured values for all such bearings of the lot, shall not be larger than 20 percent of the mean value.\n\nvi) In case of any visual defect or unacceptable stiffness during acceptance testing, all bearings of the lot shall be subjected to the same test again and only the bearing that passes the test in all respects, shall be accepted.\n\n# Tests on Specially Moulded Test Pieces\n\ni) Test pieces shall be moulded by the manufacturer with identical compound and under identical vulcanising conditions as used in the manufacture of the bearings of the acceptance lot. The process shall be open to inspection by the Inspector/Engineer.\n\nii) Test pieces offered for inspection shall be identified by suitable markings and duly certified by the manufacturer.\n\niii) The quality characteristics to be tested are listed below. The specification reference in parenthesis shall define the corresponding specification for test piece, test method and criterion for acceptance.\n\n- Composition (see Note 1 below)\n- Hardness (Table 2000-1, 1.1)\n- Tensile strength (Table 2000-1, 1.2)\n- Elongation at Break (Table 2000-1, 1.3)\n\n641\n\n\n\n# Section 2000\n\n# Bearings\n\n# Compression Set (Table 2000-1, 2)\n\n# Accelerated Ageing (Table 2000-1, 3)\n\n# Adhesion Strength (Clause 2005.1.4)\n\n# Ozone Resistance (see Note 2 below)\n\nNote 1 The properties enumerated in Clause 2005.1 and specific gravity of elastomer of test pieces from test bearing, shall be compared with those for corresponding specially moulded test pieces furnished by the manufacturer. The following variations shall be deemed maximum acceptable:\n\n- Specific Gravity + 02.\n- Ash Content \u00b1 0.5 per cent (e.g., if the ash content of elastomer from test bearing is 4%, the ash content of the specially moulded test piece shall be within 3.5% to 4.5% or vice versa)\n- Hardness (Table 2000-1, 1.1)\n- Tensile strength (Table 2000-1, 1.2)\n- Elongation at Break (Table 2000-1, 1.3)\n- Compression Set (Table 2000-1, 2)\n- Accelerated Ageing (Table 2000-1, 3)\n- Adhesion Strength (Clause 2005.1)\n\nNote 2 Ozone resistance test can be waived by the Engineer for bearings of CR when satisfactory results of ozone resistance tests on similar grade of elastomer may be available from process control records or development test data furnished by the manufacturer. Where such process control data are not available or the frequency of testing not deemed adequate, ozone resistance test shall be mandatory for acceptance of bearings of CR. However, such tests may not be insisted upon for bearings not located in adverse conditions of exposure and where the test on accelerated ageing could be considered as adequate. Process and acceptance control tests for ozone resistance by an independent testing agency shall be acceptable.\n\n# Tests on Complete Bearings or Samples\n\ni) Two bearings shall be selected at random from the lot as test bearings. The tests to be conducted are:\n\n- a) Test for determination of shear modulus (on a pair of bearings)\n- b) Test for determination of compression stiffness (on one bearing out of the selected pair).\n\n\n# Bearings\n\n# Section 2000\n\nThe test specifications and acceptance criteria shall conform to those given in Appendix-3 of IRC:83 Part II. The tested bearings shall be part of the lot accepted.\n\nii) The test for determination of shear bond strength shall be conducted on two identical bearings selected at random from the lot as test bearings or on two identical specially moulded sample bearings of plan dimension 200 mm x 300 mm and overall thickness 41 mm (3 elastomer layers of thickness 8 mm each, 4 reinforcing plates of thickness 3 mm each, face cover 2.5 mm, and side cover 4 mm) as agreed upon between the manufacturer and buyer: The test specifications and acceptance criteria shall conform to those given in Appendix-3 of IRC:83 Part II. This is a destructive test and the test bearings shall not be used in the structure.\n\n# 2005.4.3.2 acceptance testing level 2\n\nGeneral inspection: This shall conform to the provisions in Clause 2005.4.3.1 in all respects.\n\nTest on specially moulded test pieces: This shall conform to the provisions in Clause 2005.4.3.1 in all respects.\n\nTest on complete bearings: Test for determination of shear modulus shall be conducted using two bearings of the lot selected at random and conforming to relevant provisions of Clause 2005.4.3.1. These bearings shall, however, be part of the lot accepted. The remaining tests stipulated in aforesaid clause shall be carried out on two bearings selected at random which shall be excluded from the lot accepted.\n\n# 2005.4.4 special acceptance inspection\n\nSpecial acceptance inspection shall comprise the following:\n\n1. Acceptance testing by a NABL accredited independent external agency with separate or supplemental test facilities provided by it for polymer identification and confirmation about percentage of polymer content and ash content by TGA method.\n2. Acceptance testing on test pieces prepared from the surface or body of the test bearings instead of specially moulded test pieces.\n3. Acceptance testing on cut sample from finished bearing in order to measure thickness of individual layer of elastomer, dimension of laminates and flatness of laminates.\n\n\n\nSection 2000 Bearings\n\niv) Acceptance test at ULS condition. Bearings tested at ULS condition cannot be used in the structure as its performance at SLS condition cannot be guaranteed after such test.\n\nv) Acceptance tests not covered by these specifications but according to the specifications laid down by the Engineer.\n\nSpecial acceptance inspection may be specified under the following conditions:\n\n- a) Special contract agreement between the manufacturer and the buyer. Cost of additional bearings to be consumed for special acceptance inspection, shall be borne by buyer.\n- b) Evidence of unsatisfactory process or acceptance control.\n\n# 2005.4.5 Inspection Certificate\n\nA lot under inspection shall be accepted by the Inspector and so certified, when no defect is found with respect to any of the quality characteristics tested on samples drawn from the lot, according to specifications laid down to Clause 2005.4.3 covering general inspection tests on specially moulded test pieces and on complete bearings.\n\nIn case any bearing is found defective, the lot shall be rejected by the Inspector and so certified.\n\nIn case any bearing is found to be defective with respect to any quality characteristic, discerned by general inspection tests specified in Clauses 2005.4.3.1 and 2005.4.3.2, tests on specially moulded test pieces and complete bearings as applicable according to those Clauses, shall nevertheless be completed. If the said lot, rejected by general inspection, satisfies the acceptance criteria in respect of these other tests, the lot and individual bearings found defective shall be clearly identified in the inspection certificate.\n\nImmediately on completion of inspection by the Inspector authorized by the Engineer, the manufacturer shall obtain an inspection certificate which shall include the details of a lot or lots accepted/rejected by him and records of all test measurements.\n\n# 2005.4.6 Quality Control Certificate\n\nThe manufacturer shall certify for each lot of bearings under acceptance that:\n\n- a) an adequate system of continuous quality control was operated in his plant.\n- b) the entire process remained in control during the production of the lot of bearings under acceptance, as verified from the quality control records/charts which shall be open to inspection of Engineer/Inspector on demand.\n\n644\n\n\n# Bearings\n\n# Section 2000\n\nA certified copy of results of process control testing done on samples of elastomer used in the production of the lot shall be appended and shall include the following information:\n\n- Composition of compound \u2013 raw elastomer and ash content, the grade of raw elastomer used (including name, source, age on shelf), test results of hardness, tensile strength, elongation at break, compression set, accelerated ageing, etc.\n\nA higher level certification of the process quality control shall be called for at the sole discretion of the Engineer in special cases e.g. where adequate inspection of bearings similar to those comprising the lot under inspection produced in the same plant, is not available with the Engineer or where there is any evidence of process or acceptance control being deemed unsatisfactory. The higher level certification shall comprise submittal of a complete quality control report covering tests as given in Appendix 3 of IRC:83 (Part II), supplementing the quality control certificate.\n\n# 2005.4.7 Acceptance\n\nThe manufacturer shall furnish the following to Engineer for obtaining acceptance:\n\n1. Quality control certificate as laid down in Clause 2005.4.6.\n2. Inspection certificate as laid down in Clause 2005.4.5.\n\nThe manufacturer shall furnish any supplementary information on the system of quality control and/or process and acceptance control testing as may be deemed necessary by the Engineer.\n\nIn case of any evidence of process or acceptance control testing being deemed unsatisfactory by him, Engineer at his sole discretion may call for a special acceptance testing of the lot according to specifications laid down by him, without any prejudice to his right to reject the lot. The entire cost of such supplementary inspection shall be borne by the manufacturer.\n\nThe Engineer shall be the sole authority for acceptance of a lot on scrutiny of the certificates along with any supplementary evidence as mentioned in this Clause, to his complete satisfaction therewith.\n\nIn case of rejection of a lot, the Engineer shall reserve the right to call for special acceptance inspection for the succeeding lots offered for inspection, according to the specifications laid down by him. The entire cost of such tightened inspection shall be borne by the manufacturer.\n\n# 2005.5 Certification and Marking\n\nBearings shall be transported to bridge site after final acceptance by Engineer and along with an authenticated copy of the certificate to that effect.\n\n\n\nSection 2000\n# Bearings\n\nEach bearing shall be uniquely and individually numbered on its external faces for identification.

Detailing of the structure shall be such that water is prevented from reaching the bearings.\n\n656\n\nBearings\n# Section 2000\n\nii) In order to avoid contamination of moving surfaces, bearings should not normally be dismantled after leaving the manufacturer\u2019s workshop. However, if for any reason, a bearing is required to be dismantled, it shall be done only under expert supervision for which the manufacturer\u2019s help may be sought.\n\niii) Transfer of load from the superstructure to the bearings should not be allowed until the bedding material has developed sufficient strength. Temporary clamping devices should be removed at the appropriate time before the bearings are required to accommodate movement. The holes exposed on removal of temporary transit clamps should be filled with selected material. Where re-use of these fixing holes may be required, the material used for filling the holes should be capable of being easily removed without damaging the threads.\n\niv) Suitable temporary supporting arrangements under bearing base plates should be made to accommodate thermal movement and elastic deformation of the incomplete superstructure. Such temporary supports, if provided, should be removed once the bedding material has reached its required strength. Any voids left as a consequence of their removal should be made good using the same bedding material. Steel folding wedges and rubber pads are suitable for use as temporary supports under bearing plates.\n\n# 2006.5.2 Bedding\n\ni) The bedding material shall be selected keeping in view a number of factors such as the type and size of bearing, construction sequence, load on the bearing, required setting time, friction requirements, access around bearings, design and condition of surface in the bearing area and thickness, strength and shrinkage of bedding material.\n\nii) Commonly used bedding materials are cementitious or chemical resin mortar and grout. In some cases, it may be necessary to carry out trials to ascertain the most suitable material.\n\niii) The bedding material, whether above or below the bearing, should extend over the whole area of the bearing in order to ensure even loading. After installation, there shall be no voids or hard spots. The top surface of any extension of the bedding beyond the bearing shall have a downward slope away from the bearing.\n\niv) The bedding material shall be capable of transmitting the applied load to the structure without being damaged. Surfaces to receive bedding mortar shall be suitably prepared so as to be compatible with the mortar chosen.\n\n657\n\n\n# Section 2000\n\n# Bearings\n\n# 2006.5.3 Fixing of Bearings\n\n1. Bearings should be anchored in order to counter vibration and accidental impact. Anchorage should be accurately set into recesses cast into the structure using templates. The remaining space in the recesses should be filled with material capable of withstanding the loads.\n2. Bearings that are to be installed on temporary supports should be firmly fixed to the substructure by anchorage or other means to prevent disturbance during subsequent operations. Voids beneath the bearings should be completely filled with bedding material using the appropriate method.\n3. Bearings may be fixed directly to metal bedding plates that may be cast in or bedded on top of the supporting structure to the correct level and location.\n4. If the structure is of steel, the bearings may be bolted directly onto it. Care shall be taken to ensure that there is no mismatch between the bolt holes of the structure and those of the bearing.\n5. Threaded fasteners shall be tightened uniformly to avoid overstressing of any part of the bearing.\n\n# 2006.5.4 Bearings supporting in-situ Concrete deck\n\n1. Where bearings are installed prior to casting of an in-situ concrete deck, formwork around bearings should be properly sealed to prevent grout leakage. It is essential that the bearings and particularly the working surfaces are protected during concreting operations. Sliding plates should be fully supported and care taken to prevent tilting, displacement or distortion of the bearings under the weight of green concrete. Any mortar contaminating the bearings should be completely removed before it sets.\n2. For bearings supporting precast concrete or steel beams, a thin layer of synthetic resin mortar should be used between bearings and the beams. Bearings shall be bolted to anchor plates or sleeves embedded in precast concrete elements or to machined sole plates on steel elements.\n\n# 2006.5.5 installation tolerances\n\nBearings shall be located so that their centre lines are within \u00b1 3 mm of their correct position. The level of a bearing or the mean levels of more than 1 bearing at any support, shall be within a tolerance of \u00b1 0.0001 times the sum of the adjacent spans of a continuous girder, but not exceeding \u00b1 5 mm. Bearings shall be placed in a horizontal plane within a tolerance of 1 in 200 in any direction, even under superstructure in gradient.\n\n\n\n\n# Bearings\n\n# Section 2000\n\n# 2006.6 Maintenance\n\n1. Bearings shall be designed and manufactured to make them maintenance free so as to withstand undesirable effects caused by extreme atmosphere or aggressive environmental conditions/unforeseen events.\n2. Suitable easy access to the bearings shall be provided for inspection and maintenance. Provision shall also be available for jacking up the superstructure so as to allow repair/replacement of bearings.\n3. The area surrounding the bearings shall be kept clean and dry to avoid damage to the bearings. The bearings shall also be periodically cleaned to remove deposits of salts, debris, dust or other foreign material.\n4. Periodic inspection and nominal maintenance of bearings shall be carried out in order to ensure their better performance and longer life. The bearings are required to be inspected at intervals of one year for the first five years after installation and at intervals of two years thereafter.\n5. The bearings shall also be examined carefully after unusual occurrences such as passage of heavy traffic/oversized loads, earthquakes and battering by floating debris in high floods.\n\n# 2007 Inspection and Testing\n\nWhere any patented items are used, the manufacturer\u2019s certificate for the same with test proofs shall be submitted along with the design and got approved by the Engineer before their use in work.\n\n# 2008 Test and Standards of Acceptance\n\nThe materials shall be tested in accordance with these Specifications and shall meet the prescribed criteria. The work shall conform to these Specifications and shall meet the prescribed standards of acceptance.\n\n# 2009 Measurements for Payment\n\nBearings shall be measured in numbers, according to their capacities and particular specifications given on the drawings. The quantity of elastomeric bearings shall be measured in cubic centimetres of finished dimensions.\n\n\n\nSection 2000\n# Bearings\n\n# 2010 Rate\n\nThe contract unit rate of each type of bearing shall include the cost of manufacturing, supplying and fixing the bearings in position complete as specified on the drawings or as directed by the Engineer.\n\nThe rate shall also include the cost of samples and their testing as required under the specifications or as directed by the Engineer.\n\nIn case of steel bearings the rate shall include the cost of all nuts, bolts and all tests prescribed in the specifications and shown on the drawings.\n\n660\n\n\n\n# 2100\n\n# oPen Foundations\n\nNO_CONTENT_HERE\n\nOpen Foundations\n# Section 2100\n\n# 2101 desCRiPtion\n\nThe work shall cover furnishing and providing plain or reinforced concrete foundation placed in open excavation, in accordance with the drawings and these Specifications or as directed by the Engineer.\n\n# 2102 MateRials\n\nMaterials shall conform to Section 1000 of these Specifications.\n\n# 2103 GeneRal\n\nA method statement indicating the following shall be submitted by the Contractor for approval of the Engineer, well in advance of the commencement of construction of open foundation:\n\n- i) Sources of materials\n- ii) Design, erection and removal of formwork\n- iii) Production, transportation, laying and curing of concrete\n- iv) Personnel employed for execution and supervision\n- v) Tests and sampling procedures\n- vi) Equipment details\n- vii) Quality Management System to be adopted including Quality Manual\n- viii) Any other relevant information\n\nDetails of necessary arrangements for execution under water wherever necessary, shall be included in the method statement.\n\nDimensions, lines and levels shall be set out and checked with respect to permanent reference lines and permanent bench mark so that the foundations are located correctly and in accordance with the drawings.\n\nFormwork, steel reinforcement and structural concrete for open foundations shall conform to Sections 1500, 1600 and 1700 respectively of these Specifications.\n\n# 2104 WoRKMansHiP\n\n# 2104.1 Preparation of Foundations\n\nExcavation for laying the foundation shall be carried out in accordance with Section 300 of these Specifications. The last 300 mm of excavation shall be done just before laying of lean concrete below foundation. Excavation shall be made only to the exact depth as shown on the drawing. In the event of excavation having been made deeper than that shown on the drawing or as ordered by the Engineer, the extra depth shall be made up with M10 concrete in case of foundation resting on soil and with concrete of the same grade as that of the foundation, in case of foundation resting on rock. This shall be done at the cost of the Contractor and shall be considered as incidental to the work.\n\nOpen foundations shall be constructed in dry conditions and the Contractor shall provide for adequate dewatering arrangements, wherever required, to the satisfaction of the Engineer.\n\n663\n\nSection 2100\n# Open Foundations\n\nWhere light blasting is required for excavation in rock or other hard strata, the same shall be carried out in accordance with Clause 302 of these Specifications. Where blasting is likely to endanger adjacent foundations or other structures, controlled blasting with all necessary precautions shall be resorted to.\n\n# 2104.2 Setting Out\n\nThe plan dimensions of the foundation shall be set out at the bottom of foundation trench and checked with respect to original reference line and axis.\n\n# 2104.3 Construction\n\n1. Excavation for open foundations shall be carried out in accordance with Section 300 of these Specifications. For guidance regarding safety precautions to be taken, IS:3764 may be referred.\n2. For foundation resting on soil, a layer of M10 concrete of minimum thickness 100 mm shall be provided above the natural ground to provide an even surface to support the foundation concrete. Before laying of lean concrete layer, the earth surface shall be cleaned of all loose material and wetted. Care shall be taken to avoid muddy surface. If any part of the surface has become muddy due to over-wetting, the same shall be removed. If required, the M10 concrete may be laid to a thickness of more than 100 mm, as per the direction of the Engineer. No construction joint shall be provided in the lean concrete. For foundations resting on rock, the rock surface shall be cleaned of any loose material and then levelled with a layer of concrete of the same grade as that of the foundation, so as to provide an even surface.\n3. No point of the surface of the lean concrete, in the case of foundation on soil or the surface of hard rock, in the case of foundation on hard rock, shall be higher than the founding level shown on the drawing or as ordered by the Engineer. Levels of the surface shall be taken at intervals of not more than 3 metres centre-to-centre in each direction, subject to a minimum of nine levels on the surface.\n4. No formwork is necessary for the lean concrete layer. Side formwork shall be used for foundation concrete work. When concrete is laid in slope without top formwork, the slump of the concrete shall be carefully maintained to ensure that compaction is possible without slippage of freshly placed concrete down the slope. In certain cases it may be necessary to build the top formwork progressively as the concreting proceeds up the slope. Reinforcement shall be laid as shown on the drawing.\n5. Before laying foundation concrete, the lean concrete or hard rock surface shall be cleaned of all loose material and lightly moistened. Foundation concrete of required dimensions and shape shall be laid.\n\n\n\nOpen Foundations\n# Section 2100\n\ncontinuously up to the location of construction joint shown on the drawing or as directed by the Engineer.\n\nvi) The concrete surface shall be finished smooth with a trowel. The location of construction joint and its treatment shall be done as per requirements of Section 1700 of these Specifications. Formwork shall not be removed earlier than 24 hours after placing of concrete. Where formwork has been provided for top surface, the same shall be removed as soon as concrete has hardened. Curing of concrete shall be carried out by wetting of formwork before removal. After its removal, curing shall be done by laying not less than 100 mm thickness of loose moistened sand free from clods or gravel, over the concrete. The sand shall be kept continuously moist for a period of 7 days. Before backfilling is commenced, the loose sand shall be removed and disposed of as directed by the Engineer.\n\nvii) Normally, open foundations shall be laid dry. Where dewatering is necessary for laying of concrete, it shall be carried out adopting any one of the following methods or any other method, approved by the Engineer:\n\n- a) Apit or trench of suitable size, deeper than the founding level as necessary, is dug beyond the foundation excavation so that the water flows into it and the excavated surface at founding level is fully drained.\n- b) Water table is depressed by well point system or other methods.\n- c) Steel/concrete caissons or sheet piling are used for creating an enclosure for the foundations, which can subsequently be dewatered. No pumping of water shall be permitted from the time of placing of concrete up to 24 hours after placement.\n\nviii) In situations where foundations cannot be laid dry or where percolation is too heavy to keep foundation strata dry, concrete may be laid under water only by tremie. In case of flowing water or artesian spring, the flow shall be stopped or reduced to the feasible extent at the time of placing the concrete.\n\nix) Where blasting is required, it shall be carried out in accordance with Section 300 of these Specifications, observing all precautions indicated therein. Where blasting is likely to endanger adjoining foundations or other structures, necessary precautions such as controlled blasting, providing rubber mat cover to prevent flying of debris etc., shall be taken to prevent any damage.\n\nx) All spaces excavated and not occupied by the foundations or other permanent works shall be refilled with earth up to surface of surrounding ground with sufficient allowance for settlement. All backfill shall be thoroughly compacted and in general, its top surface shall be neatly graded. Backfilling shall be in accordance with Section 300 of these Specifications.\n\n665\n\nSection 2100 Open Foundations\n\nxi) In case of excavation in rock, the annular space around the footing shall be filled with M15 concrete up to the level of top of rock. Filling with M15 concrete shall also be carried out for excavations having depth up to 1.5 m in ordinary rock or 0.6 m in hard rock. In case, the excavations are even deeper so as to require further filling up to the level of top of rock, the same shall be done by boulders grouted with cement.\n\nxii) Protective works, where provided shall be completed before the onset of floods so as to avoid the risk of the foundation getting undermined.\n\n# 2105 tests and standaRds oF aCCePtanCe\n\nThe materials shall be tested in accordance with these Specifications and shall meet the prescribed criteria.\n\nThe work shall conform to these Specifications and shall meet the prescribed standards of acceptance.\n\n# 2106 toleRanCes\n\n- a) Variation in dimensions: +50 mm, -10 mm\n- b) Misplacement from specified position in plan: 15 mm\n- c) Surface unevenness measured with 3 m straight edge: 5 mm\n- d) Variation of levels at the top: \u00b1 25 mm\n\n# 2107 MeasuReMent FoR PaYMent\n\nExcavation in foundation shall be measured in cubic metres in accordance with Section 300 of these Specifications, based on the quantity ordered or as shown on the drawing.\n\nLean concrete shall be measured in cubic metres in accordance with Section 1700 of these Specifications, based on the quantity ordered or as shown on the drawing.\n\nConcrete in foundation shall be measured in cubic metres in accordance with Section 1700 of these Specifications, based on the quantity ordered or as shown on the drawing.\n\nReinforcement steel shall be measured in tonnes in accordance with Section 1600 of these Specifications, based on the quantity ordered or as shown on the drawing.\n\n# 2108 Rate\n\nThe contract unit rates for excavation in foundation, lean concrete, including dewatering and blasting where required, concrete in foundation and reinforcement steel shall include all works as given in respective Sections of these Specifications and cover all incidental items for furnishing and providing open foundation as mentioned in this Section and as shown on the drawings.\n\n666\n\n# 2200\n\n# suBstRuCtuRe\n\nNO_CONTENT_HERE\n\nSubstructure\n# Section 2200\n\n# 2201 Description\n\nThe work shall cover furnishing and providing masonry or reinforced concrete substructure in accordance with the drawings and as per these Specifications or as directed by the Engineer.\n\n# 2202 Materials\n\nMaterials shall conform to section 1000 of these Specifications.\n\n# 2203 General\n\n# 2203.1\n\nA method statement for construction indicating the following shall be submitted by the Contractor for approval of the Engineer, well in advance of the commencement of substructure:\n\n- i) Sources of materials,\n- ii) Design, erection and removal of formwork,\n- iii) Production, transportation, laying and curing of concrete,\n- iv) Personnel employed for execution and supervision,\n- v) Tests and sampling procedures,\n- vi) Equipment details,\n- vii) Quality Management System to be adopted including Quality Manual\n- viii) Safety measures\n- ix) Any other relevant information.\n\nArrangements for execution under water wherever necessary, shall be included in the method statement.\n\n# 2203.2\n\nDimensions, lines and levels shall be set out and checked with respect to permanent reference lines and permanent bench mark so that the substructure is constructed in accordance with the drawings.\n\n# 2203.3\n\nBrick masonry, stone masonry, formwork, steel reinforcement and concrete for piers, abutments, pier caps, abutment caps, dirt walls, return walls and wing walls shall conform to Sections 1300, 1400, 1500, 1600 and 1700 respectively of these Specifications.\n\n# 2204 Piers and Abutments\n\n# 2204.1\n\nFor concrete piers, horizontal construction joints shall be avoided as far as possible, by pouring the entire required concrete in one operation.

Curing of segments may be achieved through water curing or steam curing followed by water curing. Approved curing compound may also be used.\n\nIn case of spliced girder system, match casting is not necessary because the gap between the girder segments is filled with concrete or epoxy material at the location of splices. The faces which are required to receive the cast-in-situ stitch concrete, shall be adequately roughened and prepared as construction joint before pouring the stitch concrete. In case of epoxy jointed spliced girder system (with no gap between the girder segments), match casting shall be resorted to and all provisions of epoxy jointed segmental structure shall apply.\n\n678\n\nConcrete Superstructure\n# Section 2300\n\nA full scale mock-up of the lifting and holding equipment (including assembly truss, cantilevering formwork etc.) shall be performed to demonstrate their adequacy and efficacy prior to start of erection/assembly of the segments.\n\n# 2305.3.3 tolerances in Precasting\n\nFinished segment tolerances should not exceed the following:\n\n| Length of match-cast segment (not cumulative)                                                                                      | \u00b1 5 mm   |\n| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |\n| Overall span length between bearings                                                                                               | \u00b1 10 mm  |\n| Web thickness, depths of top and bottom flanges, width of top and bottom flanges, overall depth of segment, thickness of diaphragm | \u00b1 5 mm   |\n| Grade of edge and soffit                                                                                                           | \u00b1 1 mm/m |\n| Tendon hole location                                                                                                               | \u00b1 3 mm   |\n| Position of shear keys                                                                                                             | \u00b1 5 mm   |\n\n# 2305.3.4 shear Keys\n\nShear keys covering as much area of the cross-section as possible, shall be provided at match cast joints of precast segments. Shear keys in the webs shall be smaller in size and more in number than those in top flange and bottom flange, which may have larger sizes and lesser numbers. Shear keys shall be dimensioned in the form of trapezium and shall be located away from tendon holes. In case of spliced girder superstructure, where match casting is not used, large amplitude shear keys may be used.\n\n# 2305.3.5 epoxy Jointing of segments\n\nFor epoxy jointed superstructure, mating surfaces of both adjoining segments shall be effectively prepared by wire brushing, water jetting or any other approved means to ensure that bond breaking material is completely removed. Epoxy of about 1 mm thickness shall be applied (usually by hand) on each of the mating surfaces. The epoxy should not have crossed 70 percent of its shelf life at the time of application. The segments shall then be brought in contact and an axial temporary compression of at least 0.3 MPa shall be applied by approved means for a minimum of 24 hours. The erection system shall be so planned by the Contractor that the time elapsed between mixing of components of epoxy and application of temporary axial surface, does not exceed 60 minutes. No epoxy from a batch for which the time since combining the components, has exceeded 20 minutes, shall be used.\n\n679\n\nSection 2300 Concrete Superstructure\n\n# 2305.3.5.1 sequence of operation\n\nThe broad sequence of operations shall generally comprise placing of all segments which are to be assembled and prestressed in one stage touching each other and then visually examining the matching of mating surfaces. Subsequently, each segment shall be separated from adjoining segment by a distance just sufficient to enable application of the epoxy. The temporary axial compression shall then be imparted and maintained for a minimum of 24 hours. Thereafter, intended permanent prestress shall be imparted prior to demobilizing the temporary axial prestress.\n\n# 2305.3.5.2 epoxy\n\nDepending on the ambient temperature range, the following types of epoxies may be used:\n\n| 5\u00ba to 20\u00ba Celsius  | Fast reacting        |\n| ------------------ | -------------------- |\n| 15\u00ba to 30\u00ba Celsius | Medium fast reacting |\n| 25\u00ba to 40\u00ba Celsius | Slow reacting        |\n\nResin, which is one component of the epoxy, must be stirred by a mixer in its container for about 10 seconds or until homogeneity is achieved. Thereafter, the hardener which is the second component, must be added and mixing continued. For a mix of 5 kg batch, a mixing rotor attached to 350 W, 400 rpm electric hand drilling machine may be used. The speed of revolution should not exceed 400 rpm in order to avoid entrapment of air and excessive frictional heat leading to shorter pot life. The mixing time should not exceed 3 minutes. For fast reacting and medium fast reacting formulations, the temperature should not be allowed to rise above 40\u00baC while for slow reacting formulations, it should not rise above 60\u00baC. The mixing paddles should scrape the bottom and sides of the container so as to ensure complete mixing of the two components. The mixing should be carried out as close as possible to the site where the epoxy is to be used, so as to avoid loss of time and wastage of pot life in transport.\n\nEpoxy shall be tested for its conformance to the FIP-1978 \u201cProposal for Standard Tests and Verification of Epoxy Bonding Agents for Segmental Construction\u201d. Some of the important properties of epoxy (minimum values) are as follows:\n\n| Pot life             | 20 minutes at upper temperature limit                                                       |\n| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Open time            | 60 minutes at upper temperature limit                                                       |\n| Compressive strength | 60 MPa at 24 hrs and 75 MPa at 168 hrs on 50 x 50 x 50 mm cube (at lower temperature limit) |\n\n680\n\nConcrete Superstructure\n# Section 2300\n\n# Tensile bonding\n\nAfter 24 hrs at 100% strength, humidity, should have concrete failure, no joint failure with M40 concrete (at lower temperature limit)\n\n# Shear strength\n\n12 MPa (at lower temperature limit)\n\n# Curing rate\n\nCompressive strength on 50 x 50 x 50 mm cube shall be 20 MPa at 12 hrs, 40 MPa at 24 hrs and 75 MPa at 168 hrs (at lower temperature limit)\n\n# 2305.3.6 Cast in-situ Concrete Pour\n\nIn every unit of superstructure, consisting of precast segments, there shall be suitable numbers (at least one) cast in-situ concrete pour/stitch so as to ensure longitudinal alignment of the segment.\n\n# 2305.3.7 Spliced Girder system\n\nSpliced girder system in which smaller segments, usually pre-tensioned at precasting yard, are assembled together using cast in-situ concrete or epoxy and post tensioned, may be used to obtain large girder spans. For this purpose, the girder segments are temporarily supported over centering/steel tower or assembled at ground level and then post tensioned after jointing. In case of superstructures curved in plan, straight girder segments are placed along the chord line of the curvature to obtain the required geometry. In such cases, it is necessary to provide a cast in-situ cross diaphragm at each such kink in plan coinciding with the splice. The splicing can be done either before casting the deck or along with the deck. In the former case, post tensioning is imparted to the girder section alone whereas in the latter case, the post tensioning is imparted to the composite section.\n\nA preferred location of splice will be the points of minimum stress such as one-third span points. At each cast in-situ splice location, adequately designed untensioned reinforcement shall be provided by lapping, welding or use of mechanical couplers subject to the limitation of the relevant codes. However, in case of epoxy jointed splice, such reinforcement is not provided.\n\n# 2305.3.8 Prestressing ducts\n\nIn the case of dry jointed segments, the prestressing ducts shall necessarily be of HDPE. In the case of epoxy jointed segments, either metallic or HDPE ducts may be used. The ducts shall be corrugated and shall have size and thickness as per the provisions of Clause 1802.2.2 of these Specifications. Adequate precaution shall be taken to ensure that epoxy material does not leak into the joints of the ducts.\n\n681\n\nSection 2300\n# Concrete Superstructure\n\n# 2305.3.9 Prestressing Couplers\n\nIn case prestressing couplers are used, in general, not more than 50 percent of the prestressing cables passing through a section shall be coupled at that section. Longitudinally the couplers shall be staggered by at least a distance equal to segment length or twice the overall depth of girder, whichever is more. Usual practice is to couple half the cables in one span and the other half in the next span and so on. Two immediately adjacent cables shall not be provided with couplers at one section.\n\n# 2305.4 Precast Pre-tensioned Girders\n\nPrecast pre-tensioned girders can be used for superstructure of bridges in association with cast in-situ/precast deck slabs and diaphragms. They can also be made continuous either through untensioned reinforcement at the intermediate support or through post tensioning. All construction requirements of precast pre-tensioned girders shall be in accordance with the provisions of Section 1800 of these Specifications.\n\n# 2306 Cast in-PlaCe Voided slaBs\n\nVoided slabs can be either in reinforced concrete or in prestressed concrete. Voids can be either circular or rectangular in shape. Void formers may be manufactured from steel sheets, fibre reinforced cement, expanded polystyrene, HDPE, etc. They are generally corrugated to attain sufficient rigidity in order to prevent distortion or collapse during concreting. They should also be leak tight.\n\nVoid formers shall be suitably tied down in order to prevent flotation during concreting. Care shall be taken during placement of concrete to ensure that the concrete flows fully into the space beneath the void formers.\n\n# 2307 toleRanCes\n\n# 2307.1 Precast Concrete superstructure\n\n| a) Variations in thickness of top and bottom slab for box girders, top and bottom flange for T-girders and slabs | \u00b1 5 mm          |\n| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |\n| b) Variations in web thickness                                                                                   | -5 mm to +10 mm |\n| c) Variations in overall depth or width                                                                          | \u00b1 5 mm          |\n\n682\n\nConcrete Superstructure\n# Section 2300\n\nd) Variation in length overall and length: shall not exceed \u00b1 10 mm between bearings or \u00b1 0.1 percent of the span length, whichever is less\n\ne) Permissible surface unevenness in deck slab when measured with a 3 m straight edge or template: 5 mm\n\n# 2307.2 Cast in-situ superstructure\n\na) Variations in thickness of top and bottom slab for box girders, top and bottom flange for T-girders and slabs: -5 mm to +10 mm\n\nb) Variations in web thickness: -5 mm to +10 mm\n\nc) Variations in overall depth or width: \u00b1 5 mm\n\nd) Variation in length overall and length: shall not exceed \u00b1 10 mm between bearings or \u00b1 0.1 percent of the span length, whichever is less\n\ne) Permissible surface unevenness in deck slab when measured with a 3 m straight edge or template: 5 mm\n\n# 2308 tests and standards of acceptance\n\nThe materials shall be tested in accordance with these Specifications and shall meet the prescribed criteria.\n\nThe work shall conform to these Specifications and shall meet the prescribed standards of acceptance.\n\n# 2309 Measurement for payment\n\nConcrete in superstructure shall be measured in accordance with Section 1700, based on the quantity ordered or as shown on the drawings.\n\nSteel reinforcement (untensioned) in superstructure shall be measured in accordance with Section 1600, based on the quantity ordered or as shown on the drawings.\n\n683\n\nSection 2300                                                       Concrete Superstructure\nHigh tensile steel (prestressing) in superstructure shall be measured in accordance with Section 1800, based on the quantity ordered or as shown on the drawings.\n\n# 2310            Rate\n\nThe contract unit rates for concrete, steel reinforcement (untensioned) and high tensile steel (prestressing) shall include all works as given in respective Sections of these Specifications and cover all incidental items for furnishing and providing superstructure as mentioned in this Section and as shown on the drawings.\n\n684\n\n# 2400\n\n# suRFaCe and suBsuRFaCe GeoteCHniCal inVestiGation\n\nNO_CONTENT_HERE\n\nSurface and Subsurface Geotechnical Investigation\n# Section 2400\n\n# 2401 Description\n\n# 2401.1\n\nThe work shall cover investigation to determine the suitability or otherwise of the soil or rock to support the foundations of the bridge or other structure and also to determine soil parameters and rock characteristics required for the design of foundations by in-situ testing or testing of samples/cores taken from bores/drill holes. The subsurface investigation shall be carried out in such a way that the profiles of different types of soil for the entire length of the proposed structure are obtained and recorded. Other information to be obtained are mechanical and physical properties such as grain-size distribution, sensitivity, existence of deleterious material in soil or ground water, porosity of rock, subsidence due to mining, ground water level, artesian condition, likely sinking and driving effort and likely constructional difficulties.\n\n# 2401.2\n\nThe field work shall consist of excavation, drilling of boreholes for the purpose of collection of undisturbed and disturbed samples, standard penetration tests, in-situ vane tests, static and dynamic cone penetration tests, other field tests, as specified by the Engineer and preparation of bore logs. It will also include collection, preservation and testing of disturbed and undisturbed samples from boreholes, borrow pits, etc. as specified by the Engineer. All in-situ tests shall be supplemented by laboratory investigations. Relevant Indian Standards such as IS:1498, IS:1888, IS:1892, IS:2131, IS:2132, IS:2720, IS:4434 and IS:4968 and Annex 2 of IRC:78 shall be followed for guidance.\n\n# 2401.3\n\nThe soundings by dynamic method, where required shall be carried out in bore holes using a standard sampler as specified in IS:2131.\n\n# 2402 Extent and Number of Bores\n\n# 2402.1\n\nInvestigations shall cover the entire length of the bridge and also extend on either side for a distance about twice the depth below bed of the last main foundation. Bores shall be taken at the location of each pier and abutment of the bridge. A minimum of two bores shall be taken in the approaches on either side, along the centre line of the alignment, at a distance of 50 m and 120 m behind the abutment positions. In case of viaducts in the approaches on either side of the bridge, bores shall be taken at the location of each foundation of the viaduct spans.\n\n# 2402.2\n\nWhere detailed investigation indicates appreciable variation or where variations in a particular foundation are likely to appreciably affect the construction (specially in case of bridge foundations resting on rock), it will be necessary to take additional bores in the transverse direction also, to establish complete profile of the underlying strata. The number of additional bores shall be decided depending upon the extent of variation in local geology at a particular foundation location and should cover the entire area of that foundation.\n\n687\n\nSection 2400 Surface and Subsurface Geotechnical Investigation\n\n# 2403 dePtH oF BoRes\n\n# 2403.1\n\nThe bores shall be taken below the proposed founding level to a depth of at least 1\u00bd times the width of foundation. In case the soil at that level is found to be unsuitable or of doubtful bearing capacity, the depth of investigation below the proposed founding level, shall be extended to 4 times the width of foundation or till firm and stable soil or rock is met with. If rock is met with, the depth of drilling into rock having RQD more than 75, may be limited to 3 metres.\n\n# 2403.2\n\nFor embankments and guide bunds, the depth of bore should cover all strata likely to cause undesirable settlement affecting their stability. The depth of bore holes below the ground level may ordinarily be 2.5 times the maximum height of the embankment/guide bund, subject to a minimum of 20 m. However, borings can be terminated at shallower depths when firm strata or bed rock is encountered. Where highly compressible strata are encountered, the boring may have to be taken deeper. In order to ensure that firm strata is sufficiently thick, the boring should extend 3 metres into the firm strata.\n\n# 2404 detailed inVestiGation\n\n# 2404.1\n\nThe subsurface investigation for bridges shall be carried out in the following three zones:\n\n1. between bed level and up to anticipated maximum scour depth (below H.F.L.)\n2. from the maximum scour depth to the founding level\n3. from founding level to a depth of about 1\u00bd times the width of the foundation\n\nThe data required to be obtained from each zone will cover soil classification, particle size distribution, shearing strength characteristics, compressibility and permeability as detailed in Table 1 of Annex 2 of IRC:78. In all cases, samples of soils shall be collected at every 1 m to 1.5 m depth or at change of strata.\n\n# 2404.2\n\nFor high embankments, the average sheer stress of each strata below ground level and compressibility of clayey strata, if present, shall be ascertained. The location and depth of bore for undisturbed sampling, shall be such as to give information regarding boundaries of the various strata. At least one representative undisturbed sample should be collected from each strata. When the homogeneous strata is very thick, one representative sample shall be collected for each 3 m thickness of the strata.\n\n# 2404.3\n\nWhenever a change in the subsoil strata/rock profile is encountered during construction, further investigations shall be carried out to establish the correct data required for revised design of foundations, if necessary.\n\n688\n\nSurface and Subsurface Geotechnical Investigation\n\n# Section 2400\n\n# 2404.4\n\nLogging of bore holes by radioactive methods for detailed investigations, if required, shall be done as specified in the contract or in special provisions.\n\n# 2404.5\n\nFor bridge works, the investigations shall be comprehensive enough to give the following information to the designer:\n\n- i) the engineering properties of the soil/rock,\n- ii) the location and extent of soft layers, cavities and gas pockets, if any, under the hard founding strata,\n- iii) the geological condition like type of rock, faults, fissures or subsidence due to mining, cavities, hollows, porosity etc.,\n- iv) ground water level,\n- v) artesian conditions, if any,\n- vi) quality of water in contact with the foundation,\n- vii) the depth and extent of scour,\n- viii) suitable depth of foundation,\n- ix) bearing capacity of the stratum\n- x) probable settlement and differential settlement of the foundations,\n- xi) likely sinking or driving effort, and\n- xii) likely construction difficulties.\n\n# 2405\n\ndetailed investigation for bridge foundations resting on rock\n\n# 2405.1\n\nInvestigation and interpretation of data of rock strata, is a specialised work for which the services of an engineering geologist shall be availed of. To arrive at the characteristic strength of rock mass, reliance shall be placed more on in-situ tests than on laboratory tests.\n\n# 2405.2\n\nIdentification and classification of rock types for engineering purposes may in general be limited to broad, basic geological classes in accordance with accepted practice. Strength of parent rock alone is of limited value because overall characteristics depend to a large extent on character, spacing and distribution of discontinuities such as joints, bedding planes, faults and weathered seams in the rock mass. An important factor affecting the behaviour of the rock is the weathered zone at top.\n\n# 2405.3\n\nBasic information required from investigations:\n\n- i) Geological system\n- ii) Depth of rock strata and its variation over the length of the bridge\n\n689\n\nSection 2400 Surface and Subsurface Geotechnical Investigation\n\niii) Whether bed consists of isolated boulders or continuous rock formation\n\niv) Extent and character of weathered zone\n\nv) Structure of rock \u2013 including bedding planes, faults, fissures, solution cavities etc.\n\nvi) Properties of rock material \u2013 strength, geological formation, etc.\n\nvii) Colour, quality and quantity of water coming out of drill holes\n\nviii) Erodability of rock to the extent possible, where relevant\n\n# 2405.4 Extent of Investigation\n\n# 2405.4.1\n\nThe extent of investigation shall be adequate enough to cover the whole area of the bridge site for general characteristics and in particular, the foundation locations, to obtain definite information regarding depth of rock and its variation over the foundation area. A complete picture of the rock profile both in depth and across the channel width is necessary to assess the constructional difficulties in reaching the founding levels.\n\n# 2405.4.2\n\nThe depth of boring in rock depends primarily on local geology, erodibility of the rock and extent of structural loads coming on the foundations. Normally, the bore shall pass through the upper weathered or otherwise weak zone and to sufficient depth to distinguish an isolated boulder from a continuous rock formation.\n\n# 2405.5\n\nDrilling through rock is a very specialised work requiring careful noting and recording of every change that occurs during drilling. The time required to drill through a certain depth, amount of core recovery, physical condition, length of pieces of core, joints, colour of water residue, weathering and evidence of disturbance and other effects shall be carefully noted and entered in the drilling log. For guidance, IS:5313 may be referred. The data shall be recorded in accordance with IS:4464. The cores shall be stored properly in accordance with IS:4078.\n\n# 2405.6 Core Recovery and Rock Quality designation\n\nThe quality of rock cores shall be classified according to Rock Quality Designation as given in Table 2400-1.\n\n| RQD Percent | Core Quality |\n| ----------- | ------------ |\n| 90 \u2013 100    | Excellent    |\n| 75 \u2013 90     | Good         |\n| 50 \u2013 75     | Fair         |\n| 25 \u2013 50     | Poor         |\n| 25          | Very Poor    |\n\n690\n\nSurface and Subsurface Geotechnical Investigation\n\n# Section 2400\n\n# 2405.7\n\nThe rock cores obtained shall be subjected to the following tests:\n\n- i) Visual identification for texture, structure, composition, colour and grain size.\n- ii) Laboratory tests for specific gravity, porosity and moisture content.\n\n# 2405.8\n\nIn-situ tests shall be carried out for measuring strength and deformation characteristics. The in-situ tests shall be in accordance with IS:7292; IS:7317; and IS:7746. Bore hole photography will also be desirable to evaluate the presence of faults, fissures or cavities, etc. In addition, laboratory tests can also be made on samples.\n\n# 2405.9\n\nspecial Cases\n\n# 2405.9.1\n\ninvestigation for Conglomerate\n\nA drill hole shall be made same as for rock. The samples collected shall be subjected to suitable tests depending on the material. Care shall be taken to ascertain erodibility of the matrix. Where possible, especially for shallow foundation, Plate Load Test shall be conducted.\n\n# 2405.9.2\n\ninvestigation for laterites\n\nThe investigation shall be generally similar to that required for cohesive soils. Use of penetration tests shall be preferred, if suitable correlation charts are available. These may be static or dynamic penetration tests or vane shear tests. In the case of hard laterite, core drilling as for soft rocks may have to be resorted to. For laterites at shallow depths, use of Plate Load Test may be advantageous.\n\n# 2405.10\n\nCaution\n\n# 2405.10.1\n\nThe interpretation of laboratory results on rock samples depends upon the relationship of the specimens tested to the overall rock characteristics, enumerated in Annex 2 of IRC:78. For this purpose, care shall be exercised in the choice of specimen size and its orientation in relation to the joint pattern.\n\n# 2405.10.2\n\nIn some cases, the foundation behaviour will be dominated by a possible mode of failure involving movement along some joint planes, fissures or weak layer within a generally strong rock system and also by possible weathering. In-situ shear tests may be conducted wherever feasible, as such tests are likely to give more representative data than the shear tests conducted on core samples.\n\n691\n\nSection 2400\n# Surface and Subsurface Geotechnical Investigation\n\n# 2405.11 Presentation of data\n\nThe data shall be given in diagrammatic form in 3 sheets giving the following details:\n\n- sheet 1: Plan showing the position of bore-holes clearly marked so as to fix the locations which can be easily identified at a future date.\n- sheet 2: Bore log chart and test results of the samples separately for each bore hole/drill hole/pit.\n- sheet 3: Pictorial representation of the bore log data to get an overall idea of the soil profile at the cross section of the river along the length of the bridge.\n\nNote: For guidance refer to IRC:78\n\n# 2406 BoRinG\n\nBoring shall be done by any of the following methods depending on the soil type and types of samples required for the investigation.\n\n1. Auger Boring\n2. Shell and Auger Boring\n3. Percussion Boring\n4. Wash Boring\n5. Rotary Boring\n\nFor detailed subsurface investigation, only rotary drills shall be used. Casing shall also be invariably provided with diameters not less than 150 mm up to the level of rock, if any. Use of percussion or wash boring equipment shall be permitted only to penetrate through bouldery or gravelly strata for progressing the boring but not for the collection of samples. While conducting detailed borings, the resistance to the speed of drilling i.e. rate of penetration, core loss, etc., as specified in Annex-2 of IRC:78 shall be carefully recorded to evaluate the different types of strata and specially to distinguish sand from sandstone, clay from shale, etc.\n\n# 2407 ReCoRds oF BoRinGs and tRial Pits\n\n# 2407.1\n\nThe field records for the preliminary and detailed investigation shall contain the date when the boring was made, the location of the boring with reference to a permanent system of co-ordinates and the elevation of the ground surface with respect to a permanent.\n\n692\n\nSurface and Subsurface Geotechnical Investigation\n# Section 2400\n\nbench mark.

The type of tools used for borings shall be recorded. If the tools were changed at any stage, the depth at which the change was made and the reason therefore shall also be noted. Incomplete and abandoned borings shall be described with no less care than successfully completed ones. The notes shall contain everything of significance observed on the job such as the elevation at which wash water was lost from the hole.\n\n# 2407.2\n\nFor borings and trial pits, necessary information shall be given covering the following.

The usual methods for sampling conforming to IS:1892 and IS:2132 are given below:\n\n| nature of Ground | type of sample | Method of sampling                              |\n| ---------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |\n| Soil             | Disturbed      | Hand Samples Auger Samples Shell Samples        |\n|                  | Undisturbed    | Hand Samples Tube Samples                       |\n| Rock             | Disturbed      | Wash samples from Percussion or rotary drilling |\n|                  | Undisturbed    | Cores                                           |\n\n# 2409 PRoCeduRe FoR taKinG saMPles\n\n# 2409.1\n\nFor proper identification of subsurface material, sample should be recovered containing all the constituents of the materials in their proper proportion. In clayey deposits, such samples could be collected by split spoon samplers. In sandy deposits, sampling spoons shall be fitted with suitable devices for retaining samples. All data required for soil identification (Appendix-2.1 of IRC:75) should be collected from the samples so extracted when undisturbed samples are not available. Penetration test should be carried out with the standard split spoon sampler or penetrometers if the soil is coarse grained. If the soil profile is known to be fairly regular, preliminary and detailed investigation may be combined. Tube samplers can be used in place of split spoon samplers for collecting samples in clayey strata.\n\n# 2409.2 disturbed soil samples\n\n# 2409.2.1\n\nDisturbed samples of soil shall be obtained in the course of excavation and boring. For procuring samples from below the ground water level, where possible, special type of sampler shall be used. Where Standard Penetration Test is conducted, representative samples shall be obtained from the split spoon. While collecting disturbed samples from borrow areas it shall be ensured that the samples collected represent all types of borrow materials to be used in the construction of embankment and subgrade.\n\n# 2409.2.2\n\nThe size of sample generally required shall be as given in Table 2400-2.\n\nSurface and Subsurface Geotechnical Investigation\n# Section 2400\n\n# Table 2400-2: Size of Soil Sample Required\n\n| s.no. | Purpose of sample                                                                                             | Soil type               | Weight of sample Required Kg |\n| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------- |\n| 1)    | Soil identification, natural moisture content tests, mechanical analysis and index properties, chemical tests | cohesive soils          | 1                            |\n|       |                                                                                                               | sands & gravels         | 3                            |\n| 2)    | Compression tests                                                                                             | cohesive soils and sand | 12.5                         |\n| 3)    | Comprehensive examination of construction material and borrow area soil including soil stabilization          | cohesive soils          | 25-50                        |\n|       |                                                                                                               | sands gravelly soil     | 50-100                       |\n\n# 2409.2.3\n\nWhile taking out disturbed soil samples, Standard Penetration Test may also be conducted to find out the bearing capacity of the subsoils at specified levels.\n\n# 2409.3 Undisturbed Soil Samples\n\n# 2409.3.1\n\nThe location of the bore-hole shall be as indicated on the drawing or given by the Engineer. The depth of the bore-hole shall be as indicated on the drawing or shall be governed by the criteria given therein or as directed by the Engineer.\n\n# 2409.3.2\n\nSamples shall be obtained in such a manner that their moisture content and structure do not get altered. This may be ensured by use of correctly designed sampler and by careful preservation and packing.\n\n# 2409.3.3\n\nStandard Penetration Test may have to be conducted in each case to obtain additional data as directed by the Engineer. In soft clay, in-situ vane shear test as per IS:4434 may have to be conducted. Where all the three operations have to be carried out in one layer, the sequence shall be as follows: undisturbed soil sampling, in-situ vane shear test, Standard Penetration Test.\n\n# 2409.3.4\n\nFor compression test samples, a core of 40 mm diameter and about 150 to 200 mm length may be sufficient, but for other laboratory tests, a core of 100 mm diameter and 300 mm length shall be taken unless otherwise specified by the Engineer.\n\n# 2409.3.5\n\nThe upper few millimeters of both types of sample shall be removed as the soil at the bottom of the bore hole usually gets disturbed by the boring tools.\n\n# 2409.4 Rock Samples\n\n# 2409.4.1 Disturbed Samples\n\nThe sludge from percussion borings or from rotary borings which have failed to yield a core,\n\nSection 2400\n# Surface and Subsurface Geotechnical Investigation\n\nshall be collected to serve as a disturbed sample. It may be recovered by settlement of circulating water in a trough.\n\n# 2409.4.2 undisturbed samples\n\nBlock samples taken from the rock formation shall be dressed to a size of about 90 mm x 75 mm x 50 mm.\n\nCores of rock shall be taken by means of rotary drills fitted with a coring bit with core retainer, if warranted.\n\n# 2409.4.3\n\nIn case rock is met with at shallow depths, test pits or trenches may be dug. These are most dependable since they permit a direct examination of the surface, the weathered zone and discontinuities, if any. It is also possible to take representative samples for tests. For guidance, IS:4453 may be referred.\n\n# 2410 PReseRVation, HandlinG and laBellinG oF saMPles\n\n# 2410.1\n\nThe samples shall be labelled and handled carefully so that they are received in the laboratory in a fit state for examination and testing and can be correctly identified as coming from a specified trial pit or bore.\n\n# 2410.2\n\nThe disturbed material in the upper end of the tube shall be completely removed before applying wax for sealing. The length and type of material so removed should be recorded.\n\n# 2410.3\n\nThe soil at the lower end of the tube shall be reamed for a length of about 20 mm. After cleaning, both ends shall be sealed with wax applied in such a way that it does not enter the sample. Wax used for sealing should not be heated to more than a few degrees above its melting temperature. The empty space in the samplers, if any, should be filled with moist soil or saw dust and the ends covered with tight fitting caps.\n\n# 2410.4\n\nLabels Giving the Following Information Should be Affixed to the Tubes:\n\n- a) Job designation\n- b) Sample location\n- c) Boring number\n- d) Tube number\n- e) Sample number\n- f) Depth\n\n696\n\n\n\nSurface and Subsurface Geotechnical Investigation\n# Section 2400\n\n- g) Penetration\n- h) Gross recovery ratio\n\nThe tube and boring numbers should be marked in duplicate. The boring number and sample number should also be marked on a sheet of material which will not be affected by moisture and enclosed in the tube.\n\n# 2411 tests For investigation of Shallow Foundations of Bridges\n\n2411.1 Digging of test pits or trenches is the most dependable method of investigation, since it permits direct and reliable visual examination of the type of soil and its stratification. In-situ tests like plate bearing tests, shear tests and uni-axial jacking tests can also be conveniently carried out in the test pits.\n\n2411.2 Tests shall be conducted on undisturbed samples, which may be obtained from open pits. The use of Plate Load Test (as per IS:1888) is considered desirable to ascertain the safe bearing capacity and settlement characteristics. A few exploratory bore holes or soundings extending to a depth of about 1\u00bd times the proposed width of foundation shall also be made to ascertain whether there is any weak strata underlying the foundation. The results of laboratory tests shall be correlated with those of in-situ tests like Plate Load Tests and Penetration Test.\n\n# 2412 tests For investigation For Deep Foundations of Bridges\n\n2412.1 The tests to be conducted for obtaining the properties of soil are different for cohesive soils and for cohesionless soils. These are enumerated below and shall be carried out, wherever practicable, according to soil type. While selecting the tests and interpreting the results, limitation of applicability of particular tests shall be taken into account. A most suitable and appropriate combination of tests shall be chosen, depending on the properties needed for design and constructional aspects.\n\n# 2412.1.1 Cohesionless soil\n\n- a) Laboratory Tests\n- i) Classification tests, index tests, density determination, etc.\n- ii) Shear strengths by triaxial/direct shear, etc.\n\nSection 2400\n# Surface and Subsurface Geotechnical Investigation\n\n# 2412.1.1 Field Tests\n\n- i) Plate Load Test (as per IS:1888)\n- ii) Standard Penetration Tests (as per IS:2131)\n- iii) Dynamic Cone Penetration Test (as per IS:4968 Part I or Part II)\n- iv) Static Cone Penetration Test (as per IS:4968 Part III)\n\n# 2412.1.2 Cohesive soil\n\n# a) Laboratory Tests\n\n- i) Classification tests, index tests, density determination, etc.\n- ii) Shear strengths by triaxial/direct shear, etc.\n- iii) Unconfined Compression Test (as per IS:2720 Part X)\n- iv) Consolidation Test (as per IS:2720 Part V)\n\n# b) Field Tests\n\n- i) Plate Load test (as per IS:1888)\n- ii) Vane Shear Test (as per IS:4434)\n- iii) Static Cone Penetration Test (as per IS:4968 Part III)\n- iv) Standard Penetration Tests (as per IS:2131)\n- v) Dynamic Cone Penetration Test (as per IS:4968 (Part I or Part II)\n\n# 2412.1.3\n\nFor both cohesionless and cohesive soils where dewatering is expected, permeability tests may be conducted as per IS:2720 Part XVII.\n\n# 2412.2\n\nThe subsoil water shall be tested for chemical properties to ascertain whether there is any hazard which may cause deterioration of concrete in foundations. Where dewatering is expected to be required, permeability characteristics shall also be determined.\n\n# 2413 Testing of Material for Foundations of Guide Bunds and High Embankments\n\n# 2413.1\n\nThe soil properties of the embankment foundation shall be got verified prior to start of construction in order to ascertain whether they conform to the requirements as specified in particular specifications. In case they do not, then the embankment design will have to be got revised.\n\n# 2413.2\n\nIn addition to the relevant identification tests, mentioned in IRC:75, it shall be necessary to conduct some of the following tests on the undisturbed samples collected from\n\n698\n\nSurface and Subsurface Geotechnical Investigation\n# Section 2400\n\nthe sub-strata. The choice of test is primarily determined by the type of soil, type of stability analysis (vide Table 2400-3), availability of apparatus and cost of investigation.\n\n# table 2400-3 : shear strength tests for stability analysis\n\n| s. no. | stage in life of embankment                            | strength Parameters | shear test                                                                                                                           | type of analysis          |\n| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------- |\n| 1)     | (a) During construction or immediate post-construction | cuu, \u03a6uu            | Unconsolidated undrained triaxial shear test on undisturbed samples and on compacted embankment material                             | Total stress analysis     |\n|        | (b) \u2014 do \u2014-                                            | Su                  | Unconfined compression test in laboratory or vane shear test                                                                         | \u2014 do \u2014-                   |\n|        | (c) \u2014 do \u2014-                                            | C\u03a6                  | Consolidated undrained test with pore-pressure measurement on compacted soil samples embankment materials and on undisturbed samples | Effective stress analysis |\n| 2)     | Long term stability                                    | C\u03a6                  | \u2014 do \u2014-                                                                                                                              | \u2014 do \u2014-                   |\n\n2413.3 The results of reconnaissance, field and laboratory investigations for embankments shall be compiled into a well-knit report.

In case, the stratum is such that undisturbed samples cannot be collected using ordinary sampler, they shall be collected using piston sampler or core-cutter or such special devices as directed by the Engineer. In thick layers undisturbed samples shall be collected at 3 m intervals.\n\n# 2414 MeasuReMent FoR PaYMent\n\nFor bridge and road structures, the work of boring and trial pits shall be considered as incidental to the foundation works and nothing extra shall be paid unless otherwise specified.\n\n699\n\nSection 2400\n# Surface and Subsurface Geotechnical Investigation\n\nIn the contract.

The construction of embankment for guide bund shall conform to provisions of Section 300 of these Specifications. Pitching, filter underneath pitching and turfing, apron, toe protection, curtain walls, etc., shall be as per these Specifications.\n\n# 2502.3\n\nGuide bunds shall be made of locally available materials. Trial pits shall be taken in borrow areas to examine suitability of soil for construction and also to decide the types of earth moving machinery to be used. No borrow pits should be dug on the river side of the guide bunds. Construction of guide bund shall be taken in hand along with the construction of the bridge. Every effort shall be made to complete the work of the guide bund in one working season. Where this is not possible, suitable measures shall be planned and executed for protection of completed work. In such cases, the construction of guide bund shall be started from abutment towards upstream.\n\n# 2502.4\n\nConstruction of apron and pitching of the guide bunds shall conform to Clauses 2503 and 2504 of these Specifications. Sufficient area along the side of the guide bund shall be ready within one to two months of commencement of work, so that the placing of stones in the apron and in the slope pitching can be commenced. As a guideline, earth work should be completed within 80 percent of the working season. Also, about 70 percent of the working season shall be available for laying apron and pitching. No portion of the guide bund should be left incomplete below high flood level before the onset of the monsoon. Bottom of apron pit shall be as low as permitted by subsoil water/lowest water level.

Gabions shall be manufactured with a 10 x 12 or 8 x 10 mesh type (Fig. 2500-1) having a nominal mesh opening size as per Table 2500-2. Dimensions are measured at right angles to the center axis of the opening and parallel to the twist along the same axis.\n2. Revet mattresses shall be manufactured with a 6 x 8 mesh type (Fig. 2500-1) having a nominal mesh opening size as per Table 2500-2. Dimensions are measured at right angles to the center axis of the opening and parallel to the twist along the same axis.\n3. The width and length of the gabions and revet mattresses as manufactured shall not differ more than +/- 5% from the ordered size prior to filling. Typical gabion and revet mattress sizes are shown in Tables 2500-2 and 2500-3 respectively.\n4. The height of the gabions and revet mattresses as manufactured shall not differ more than +/- 10% if the height is less than or equal to 0.3 m and shall not differ more than +/- 5% if the height is more than 0.3 m from the ordered size prior to filling.\n5. Mesh Opening Tolerances \u2013 Tolerances on the hexagonal, double-twisted wire mesh opening shall not exceed +16% to \u20134% on the nominal dimension D values mentioned in Table 2500-1.\n\nFig. 2500-1 : Mesh type &#x26; nominal size \u2018d\u2019\n\n# 2503.3.1.4\n\nTerminology, mechanical properties, physical properties, number of tests and test methods related to mechanically woven wire crates shall be as per Appendix-2500/I.\n\n# 2503.3.2 Hand Woven Wire Crates\n\nWire crates shall be made from hot dipped galvanized mild steel wire of diameter not less than 4 mm in annealed condition having tensile strength of 300 MPa-450 MPa conforming to IS:280. The galvanizing shall be heavy coating for soft condition conforming to IS:4826. The mesh size of the crate shall not be more than 150 mm.\n\n707\n\nSection 2500\n# River Training and Protection Work\n\nWire crates for shallow or accessible situations shall be 3 m x 1.5 m x 1.25 m in size. Where these have to be deposited and there is a possibility of overturning, the crate shall be divided into 1.5 m compartments by cross netting.\n\nFor deep or inaccessible situations, wire crates can be made smaller subject to the approval of the Engineer.\n\nWire crates built in-situ, shall not be larger than 7.5 m x 3 m x 0.6 m, nor smaller than 2 m x 1 m x 0.3 m. Sides of large crates shall be securely stayed at intervals of not more than 1.50 m to prevent bulging.\n\nThe netting shall be made by fixing a row of spikes on a beam at a spacing equal to the mesh. The beam must be a little longer than the width of netting required. The wire is to be cut to lengths about three times the length of the net required. Each piece shall be bent at the middle around one of the spikes and the weaving commenced from the corner.\n\nA double twist shall be given at each intersection. The twisting shall be carefully done by means of a strong iron bar, five and half turns being given to the bar at each splice.\n\nThe bottom and two ends of the crate or mattress shall be made at one time. The other two sides shall be made separately and shall be secured to the bottom and the ends by twisting adjacent wires together. The top shall be made separately and shall be fixed in the same manner as the sides after the crates or mattress have been filled.\n\n# 2503.3.3 laying of Wire Crates\n\nWherever possible, crates shall be placed in position before filling with boulders. Undulations in the bed shall be levelled prior to placement of wire crate units. The crates shall be filled by carefully hand-packing the boulders as tightly as possible and not by merely throwing in the stones or boulders.\n\nWhere the crates are to be laid on the sides and bed of the stream in underwater conditions, they shall be prefilled on dry area, lifted by cranes using suitable size frames with lifting slings at every 0.5 m to 1 m maximum spacing and placed at designated locations.

A retest for conformance with the aforementioned strength tests shall be required when changes of the physical characteristics of the mesh products occur. For galvanized steel wire with PVC coating, the same requirements as for the galvanized steel wire mesh shall be followed. The results of all three tests must meet the requirements of Table-2500/1.\n\n# 5 Test Methods\n\n# 5.1 Tensile Strength of Wire Mesh Panel\n\nThe wire mesh specimens shall be representative of proper field construction as to materials, mesh geometry, and workmanship, and shall be as large as practical to minimize the effect of variations. The tests shall be run with the load applied parallel to the axis of the twist and repeated on a separate test specimen with the load applied perpendicular to the axis of the twist.\n\nPlace the mesh into the machine grips such that the gripped mesh will be maintained in the mesh geometry characteristic of field use. The specimen of approximately 0.8 m width and 0.5 m height shall be tested. The effective width to be considered for test specimen shall be the distance between two extreme gripping points. The specimen should extend by at least one mesh repetition beyond the extreme gripping points on either side. However, specimen should not extend more than two mesh repetitions beyond extreme gripping points. The mesh shall be pre-loaded to 10 percent of the specified minimum strength and machine head travel stopped. The mesh gauge dimensions shall be recorded at this time and taken as the initial dimensions of the specimen where such dimensions are required. If the sample slips at any of the gripping point during the test, such a test shall be discarded and a new sample shall be taken. The loading shall then continue uniformly maintaining the displacement rate of 75 to 100 mm per minute, until first fracture or unwrapping of an individual wire in the system occurs. The distortion of the mesh or changes in gauge length shall be measured to accuracy consistent with reporting the percent elongation to the nearest 0.5 percent.\n\n# 5.2 Punch Test\n\nThe punch test could be done using two different apparatus.\n\ni) Pre-tensioned Punch test\n\nAn uncut section of 1.82 m in length (unselvedged) and not less than 0.91 m in width shall have the ends securely clamped for 0.91 m along.\n\n718\n\n# River Training and Protection Work\n\n# Section 2500\n\nThe width of the sample. When the width of the section under test exceeds 0.91 m, the clamps shall be centered along the width and the excess width will be allowed to fall free on each side of the clamped section. The sample shall then be subjected to tension sufficient to cause 10 % elongation of the sample section between the clamps. After elongation and while clamped as described above (and otherwise unsupported), the section shall be subjected to a load over 960 cm\u00b2 of area applied to the approximate center of the sample section between the clamps and in a direction perpendicular to the direction of the tension force.\n\n# ii) secured Punch test\n\nAn uncut section of 1.24 m in length and not less than 0.9 m in width (selvedged), including all selvedge bindings, shall have the sides and the ends securely clamped at every mesh opening to a rigid frame. After being secured as described above, the section shall be subjected to a load over 960 cm\u00b2 applied to the approximate center of the sample section between the clamps and in a direction perpendicular to the direction of the tension force. The sample shall withstand, without rupture of any strand or opening of any mesh fastening, an actual load applied by means of a circular ram at a uniform rate not to exceed 220 N/s equalling or exceeding the values shown in Table-2500/1. The ram head used in the test shall be circular with a 350 mm diameter and have its edges bevelled or rounded to prevent cutting of the wire strands.\n\n# iii) Pull-apart Resistance test\n\nA set of two identical rectangular gabion panels, each with a width about 10 1 mesh openings along a selvedge wire, shall be joined by properly ~~2~~ installed wire fasteners along the two selvedge wires so that each fastener confines two selvedge and two mesh wires. If the fasteners are also to be used to join two individual empty gabion baskets, two additional selvedge wires that are each mechanically wrapped with mesh wires shall be included so that each fastener confines four selvedge and four mesh wires. The set of the jointed panels shall be subject to pull-apart resistance test.\n\nThe specimen shall be mounted on a loading machine with grips or clamps such that the panels are uniformly secured along the full width. The grips or clamps shall be designed to only transmit tension forces. The load will then be applied at a uniform rate not to exceed 220 N/s until failure occurs. The failure is defined as when the maximum load is reached and a drop of strength is observed with subsequent loading or alternately the opening between any two closest selvedge wires, applicable to a fastener confining either two or four selvedge wires, becomes greater than 50 mm at any place along the panel width. The strength requirements of the jointed panels at failure shall be as shown in Table-2500/4.\n\nSection 2500\n# River Training and Protection Work\n\n# 5.2 Metallic Coating Weight\n\nCoating weight tests and adhesion tests shall be performed as per IS:4826.\n\n# 5.3 PVC Coating thickness\n\n1. The thickness of the PVC coating shall be determined on a randomly chosen individual piece of wire removed from the mesh.\n2. Measure with a micrometer the diameter of the metallic coated steel wire with PVC coating. Determine the thickness of the PVC coating by stripping the PVC coating from the wire and measure the reduced diameter with a micrometer. The thickness of the coating is the difference between the diameter of the metallic coated steel wire with PVC coating and the measured diameter of the metallic coated steel wire divided by two. The average value should be in accordance with Tables 2500/2, and 2500/3 of Specifications for gabions and revet mattresses respectively. When removing the PVC coating by stripping, care shall be taken not to remove any of the metallic surface.\n\n720\n\n# 2600\n\n# eXPansion Joints\n\nNO_CONTENT_HERE\n\nExpansion Joints\n\n# Section 2600\n\n# 2601 Description\n\nThe work shall consist of fabrication and installation of expansion joints.

Detailed Installation Manual shall be supplied by the manufacturer/supplier.\n\nii) The dimensions of the recess in the deck shall be established in accordance with the drawings or design data of the manufacturer, taking into account the width of gap for movement of the joint.\n\niii) The pre-setting of expansion joint shall be done by means of an auxiliary construction.\n\niv) The road surfacing/wearing coat shall be laid before commencing installation of joint. Before laying wearing coat, the recess portion shall be filled with sand and wearing coat shall be laid in a continuous manner over the deck slabs and recess portion. Prior to installation of the joints, portion of wearing coat over the recess shall be removed by a suitable method e.g. saw cutting and the infill sand shall also be removed.\n\nv) Preparation of the Recess: The size and form of recess shall suit the geometry of the expansion joint. However, the width shall not be less than the specified value for a particular type of joint. In order to avoid difficulties during installation, the following points must be checked and considered:\n\n- a) Dimension of recess\n- b) Levels\n- c) Skew and slope\n- d) Designed gap between bridge deck and abutment and/or between adjoining decks\n- e) Existing structural reinforcement according to the drawings\n\nReinforcing bars that would obstruct the installation of expansion joint shall be bent to accommodate the expansion joint anchorages. Cutting off or removal of interfering reinforcing bars shall only be done after consultation with the Engineer.\n\n736\n\n# Expansion Joints\n\n# Section 2600\n\nThe recess shall be cleaned thoroughly. If necessary, the surface should be roughened. All loose dirt and debris shall be removed by wire brushing, air blowing and dried with hot compressed air.\n\n# vi) Shuttering\n\nShuttering must be used to seal the space between the underside of the joint and the vertical face of the recess. The shuttering must be fitted in such a way that it forms an appropriate seal against the edge of the recess. The recess shall be shuttered in such a way that dimensions shown on the drawing are maintained. The formwork shall be rigid and firm.\n\n# vii) Placing in the Recess\n\nLevel marks shall be set next to the recess. This enables a controlled leveling of the expansion joint. Lowering the expansion joint/joint construction/insert into the recess shall be done in such a way that the entire length of the joint is evenly lowered into the recess. Thereafter, the joint/joint construction/insert is precisely leveled and adjusted in the longitudinal, transverse and vertical planes. If required, the joint must also be adjusted to the gradient of the final surface level.\n\n# viii) Connection\n\na) The expansion joint/joint construction/insert shall be installed preferably in the early morning when the temperature is distributed almost uniformly over the whole bridge. Immediately before the installation, the actual temperature of the bridge shall be measured. If it is not within the considered tolerance, the preset adjustment shall be corrected. The joint/joint construction/insert shall be lowered in a predetermined position. Following placement of the joint/joint construction/insert in the prepared recess, the joint/joint construction/insert shall be leveled and finally aligned and the anchorage steel on one side of the joint welded to the exposed reinforcement bars of the structure. Upon completion, the same procedure shall be followed for the other side. With the expansion joint/joint construction/insert finally held at both sides, the auxiliary brackets shall be released, allowing it to take up the movement of the structure. After carrying out the final fixing, the protection against corrosion shall be completed.\n\nb) For fully assembled joints with one end fixed and other end movable e.g. modular strip/box seal joint, connection shall be as detailed below:\n\nthe 1st side: The fixed side of the assembled joint (either the abutment or the bridge deck side) is designated the 1st side for connecting the joint. The preliminary fixing is made by evenly placing and welding of reinforcing bars over the entire length between the anchor loops and the\n\n737\n\nSection 2600\n# Expansion Joints\n\ndeck reinforcement. To facilitate concreting, it the gap between recess and shuttering is sealed by a grout seam. The seam must be left to dry prior to final concreting. After this, additional reinforcing bars are welded until all anchor loops are firmly connected to the deck reinforcement. The expansion joint shall be considered sufficiently fixed when no vibration is noted when it is lightly tapped. The expansion joint shall not be subjected to any loads that could in any way displace the precise location of this fixing.\n\nthe 2\u207f\u1d48 side: Depending on the size of the expansion joint and the expected movement during installation, the most suitable time must be determined for fixing of the 2\u207f\u1d48 (moveable) side. Usually this is the early morning hours with the smallest temperature deviations. The procedure is identical to that for the 1st side. The joint shall be provisionally fixed to the reinforcement as fast as possible. Immediately afterwards, the fixation brackets shall be removed. Thereafter, the gap between recess and shuttering shall be sealed with grout seam and the remaining reinforcing bars welded as described previously.\n\n# ix) Concreting\n\na) Prior to final concreting, the position of the joint/joint construction/insert must be recorded. The Engineer must give written confirmation of the correct position of the joint and recess concreting. The recess shall be thoroughly watered. Before pouring the concrete the joint construction should be protected by a cover. Controlled concrete having strength not less than that in superstructure subject to a minimum of M35, shall be filled into the recess. The water cement ratio shall not be more than 0.4. If necessary, admixtures may be used to improve workability. The concrete must exhibit low shrinkage. The freshly placed concrete shall be properly vibrated. Damage to the shuttering shall be avoided during vibration. The concrete shall be finished flush with the carriageway surfacing. The concrete shall be kept damp until it has cured in order to avoid fissures caused by drying too fast. After the concrete has cured, the movable installation brackets and shuttering still in place shall be removed.\n\nb) For modular strip seal joint the space beneath the joint boxes shall be completely filled with concrete. So that traffic loads are safely transmitted into the structure.\n\n# x) As soon as the concrete in the recess has become initially set\n\na sturdy ramp shall be placed over the joint to protect it from traffic at site.\n\n738\n\nExpansion Joints\n# Section 2600\n\nExpansion joint shall not be exposed to traffic loading before completion of carriageway surfacing.\n\n1. The elastomeric sealing element may be field installed. For strip seal and modular strip seal joints the sealing element shall be in continuous lengths spanning the full carriageway width. Proper fit of the seal of the sealing element must be ensured. The seal shall be installed by suitable methods in such a way that it is not damaged.\n\n# 2610.2 Specific Procedure for Asphaltic Plug Joint\n\n1. The recess in the deck slab, if required, shall be repaired with epoxy mortar and cleaned and dried again.\n2. The foam caulking/backing rod shall be placed about 25 mm down into the joint opening.\n3. The aggregate shall be washed, cleaned and heated to a temperature between 120\u00baC and 180\u00baC prior to placement.\n4. The binder shall be preheated to temperature of 170\u00baC to 190\u00baC before application.\n5. While sealing the joint opening with preheated binder, care shall be taken that the binder does not spill on to the surface of the deck.\n6. The joint shall not be installed when the ambient temperature goes below 5\u00baC or above 35\u00baC or while it is raining/ snowing. Planning for installation shall take into account the weather condition.\n7. When work is resumed after stoppage due to weather condition, the joint installation shall be continued after the upper layer and/or exposed surface of the partially completed joint has been prepared by heating and/or coating with binder as necessary.\n8. The joint shall be provided over the entire width of the structure including kerb and/or footpath. A recess in the kerb and/or footpath shall be made to allow the joint to pass beneath them. The expansion gap in the adjoining kerbs and/or footpaths shall be sealed with a suitable sealant such as polysulphide sealant.\n9. The joint shall extend to the full depth of the wearing course down to structural concrete. Where needed, a recess may be cut into the deck slab concrete to accommodate the minimum required depth (75 mm) of the joints.\n10. The minimum width (in traffic direction) of the joint shall be 500 mm and maximum width shall be 750 mm.\n11. Minimum depth of joint shall be 75 mm and maximum depth shall not exceed 100 mm.\n\n739\n\nSection 2600\n# Expansion Joints\n\n# 2610.3 Specific Procedure for Compression Seal Joint\n\n1. The dimension of the joint recess and the width of the gap shall conform to the approved drawing.\n2. Anchoring steel shall be welded to the main reinforcement in the deck maintaining the level and alignment of the joint.\n3. The width of the recess shall not be less than 300 mm on either side of the joint. Care shall also be taken to ensure efficient bonding between already cast/existing deck concrete and the concrete in the joint recess.\n4. At the time of installation, joint shall be clean and dry and free from spalls and irregularities, which might impair a proper joint seal.\n5. The lubricant cum adhesive shall be applied to both faces of the joint and joint seal prior to installation in accordance with the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\n6. The joint seal shall be compressed to the specified thickness for the rated joint opening and ambient temperature at the time of installation which shall be between 5\u00baC and 35\u00baC.\n7. The joint seal shall be installed without damage to the seal. Loose fitting or open joints shall not be permitted.\n\n# 2610.4 Specific Procedure for Single Strip/Box Seal Joint\n\n1. The width of the gap to cater for movement due to thermal effect, pre-stress, shrinkage and creep, superstructure deformations (if any) and substructure deformations (if any) shall be determined and intimated to the manufacturer. Depending upon the temperature at which the joint is likely to be installed, the gap dimension shall be preset.\n2. Immediately prior to placing the joint, the pre-setting shall be inspected. In case the actual temperature of the structure is different from that taken for pre-setting, suitable correction shall be done. After adjustment, the brackets shall be tightened again.\n3. Rolled up neoprene strip seal shall be cut to the required length and inserted between the edge beams by using a crow bar pushing the bulb of the seal into the steel grooves of the edge beams.\n4. The carriageway surfacing shall be finished flush with the top of the steel sections. The actual junction of the surfacing/wearing coat with the steel edge section shall be formed by a wedge shaped joint with a sealing compound. The horizontal leg of the edge beam shall be cleaned beforehand. It is particularly important to ensure thorough and\n\n740\n\nExpansion Joints\n\n# Section 2600\n\nCareful compaction of the surfacing in order to prevent any premature depression forming in it.\n\n# 2610.5 Specific procedure for Modular Strip/Box Seal Joint\n\n1. The procedure given in Clause 2610.4 (i) and (ii) applies to modular strip/box seal joint also.\n2. To ensure proper fit of the seal, dirt, spatter or standing water shall be removed from the steel cavity using a brush, scraper or compressed air.\n3. The actual junction of the surfacing/wearing coat with the block out concrete/steel edge section shall be cleaned beforehand. It is particularly important to ensure thorough and careful compaction of the surfacing in order to prevent any premature depression forming in it.\n\n# 2610.6 Specific Procedure for Reinforced Elastomeric Joint\n\nExpansion joints shall be installed as per approved drawing. The procedure for installation of various components shall be as follows:\n\n1. Steel Inserts\n1. Deck casting shall be done leaving pockets or recesses for steel inserts and anchors of the expansion joint as per drawing.\n2. Steel inserts shall be lowered at the appropriate location inside the pocket.\n3. The top of the insert shall be flush with the finished level of wearing course maintaining the camber.\n4. Spacer bars, duly set appropriately to the month of installation, shall be fitted under proper supervision.\n5. Anchor rods shall be tied/welded with the existing deck main reinforcement, maintaining level and alignment.\n6. Welding between anchor rods and deck reinforcement is preferable. If welding is not possible, strong steel tie wires shall be used for fastening under proper supervision.\n2. Spacer Bar\n1. Spacer bars shall be used to ensure proper positioning of bolts and also leveling of the steel inserts during fixing of the same with the deck reinforcement and casting second stage concreting in the pocket thereafter.\n2. The 2\u207f\u1d48 stage concreting operation shall preferably be started within 24 hours of fixing the steel inserts. In such cases, spacer\n\n# Section 2600\n\n# Expansion Joints\n\nbars should be removed just after concreting is finished. If there is a substantial time lag between fixing of inserts and concreting, then any one of the following methods shall be adopted, depending on the support condition:\n\nFor simply supported bridge resting on simple elastomeric bearings, (with no dowel pins), insert shall be placed in position with spacer bars at every alternate joints. Such joints shall be called restrained joints hereafter. In other words, inserts shall not be fixed simultaneously at two ends of one span. If the above condition is satisfied, inserts with spacer bars shall be kept in position for a substantially longer period at such restrained joints. Spacer bars shall be removed after concreting of such restrained joints and inserts placed in position with spacer bars at the other unrestrained joints thereafter.\n\nFor bridges resting on other than elastomeric bearings (including bearings with dowel pins at one end), after placing and aligning the inserts and securing the same, the spacer bars shall be removed. Concreting shall be done with great care so that inserts are not dislocated or distorted.\n\n# c) While removing the spacer bar after concreting\n\none must take care to see that the concrete is not damaged during withdrawal of spacer bar. If the spacer bar happens to be snugly fitted, it shall not be pulled by any means; it shall be gas cut in two pieces and then removed.\n\n# iii) Concreting of Pocket\n\n# a)\n\nConcreting of pocket shall be done with great care using proper mix conforming to grade similar to that of the deck casting besides ensuring efficient bonding between deck and steel insert. Also proper care shall be given for ensuring efficient bonding with the already cast concrete. Requirement of concrete as per Clause 2610.9.1 shall be followed.\n\n# b)\n\nNeedle vibrators shall be used. Care shall be taken so that the position of steel insert is not disturbed during vibration.\n\n# c)\n\nSpacer bar shall be removed within an appropriate time before the joint is required to permit movement.\n\n# iv) Fixing of elastomeric slab unit (esu)\n\n# a)\n\nSpecial jig shall be used to preset the ESU during installation.\n\n# b)\n\nESU (mounted on the jig, if preset) shall be lowered to position.\n\n742\n\n# Expansion Joints\n\n# Section 2600\n\n1. The line and level on the ESU should be adjusted.\n2. ESU shall be removed and coated with special adhesive.\n3. ESU shall be placed in position again, ensuring waterproof joining at required faces.\n4. ESU shall be tightened with stainless steel nuts and lock washers in position. Tightened nuts shall be locked with lock washers.\n5. Special sealant shall be poured inside the plug holes.\n6. The elastomeric plugs shall be pressed in position after applying adhesive on the appropriate surface.\n7. ESU shall be fitted in position after completion of wearing course. While completing this part of the wearing course, adequate care shall be taken to ensure a waterproof joining with the already existing wearing course.\n\n# v) Pre-setting\n\n1. The main purpose of pre-setting of the steel inserts at the time of its installation is to ensure as closely as possible the condition that in the long run at the mean average annual temperature, the ESU remains at its nominal state. The steel insert unit of expansion joint can be fixed in any month of the year. The expansion gap between bridge super structures may vary from time to time; hence the initial fixing distance between fixing points will obviously depend on the month of installation of steel insert. The c/c distance between stainless steel fixing of bolts as indicated in the drawing can be taken as only nominal. The same shall be modified by pre-setting depending on:\n- The difference between the mean temperature of the month of fixing of steel insert and the annual average temperature, and\n- The elapsed period between the casting and/or pre-stressing and fixing of steel insert for calculating the remnant creep and shrinkage.\n\n# vi) Special Requirements for installation\n\n1. The supplier shall provide detailed working drawings showing the location of all bolts, recesses and holes necessary for the installation of the joint shall be obtained from the supplier before construction of bridge deck area adjacent to the joint. If required detailing of reinforcing bars in superstructure shall be modified to ensure that there will be no interference in the installation of the joint.\n\nSection 2600\n# Expansion Joints\n\nb) All bearing surfaces and recesses which are in contact with the joint assembly shall be checked with a straight edge to ensure flatness of profile.\n\nc) No holes shall be drilled for fixing bolts within 7 days of concreting. Holes for the bolts shall be drilled to the size and depth shown on the drawings.\n\nd) Sections of the jointing making the completed joint shall follow a straight line.\n\ne) The fixing bolts shall not be placed in a position until at least 4 weeks after stressing is completed in post-tensioned box or beam and slab structures. Prior to placing sections of jointing, contact surfaces shall be cleaned to remove all grease, tar, paint, oil, mud or any other foreign material that may affect adhesion of the sealant.\n\nf) Sealant shall only be applied to dry contact surfaces. Sufficient quantity shall be applied to the contact surfaces so that sealant is extruded when the jointing is fixed in position.\n\ng) Final sealing of the finished expansion joint shall be completed immediately after installation. All exposed ends, joints between units, other areas of possible leakage, voids between the sides of the jointing and concrete or plates, shall be filled with sealant.\n\nh) Bolt cavities shall be cleaned and plugged with neoprene cavity plugs. Prior to placing the plugs sufficient sealant shall be placed in the cavities to cause extrusion of the sealant by the plugs.\n\ni) All excess sealant shall be removed from the jointing and adjacent areas.\n\n# 2611\n\nProcedure for installation of various joints, shall also take into account suppliers own specific procedures for installation of each type of joint as the suppliers shall be responsible for performance of the joints for the period of guarantee.\n\n# 2612\n\n# testinG and aCCePtanCe standaRds\n\n# 2612.1\n\nBefore installing joints in a bridge, sufficient evidence of the reliability of the proprietary products shall be furnished. A copy of the fatigue and wear test reports, as applicable depending upon the type of joint, carried out by a recognized laboratory/university/institute on the joint components as a part of product development test, shall be furnished once for the entire lot of supply. The tests covered in Clauses 2612.1. (i) to 2612.1. (vi) need not be carried out on the materials of the joints of supply lot but shall be carried out from time to time by the original manufacturer as per their product development and quality plan for the\n\n744\n\nExpansion Joints\n# Section 2600\n\nsame type of joints to ensure the performance requirement of the particular joint component against fatigue and/or wear.\n\n1. For single strip seal and modular strip seal joints, the manufacturer shall produce complete report of the test of anchorage system from a recognized laboratory to determine optimum configuration of anchorage assembly under dynamic loading in support of the efficacy of the anchorage system adopted for the entire lot of joints.\n2. For modular strip seal joints the manufacturer shall produce a test report from a recognized laboratory that the sliding bearings (suspension system) have been fatigue tested for six million load cycles with a frequency of 5 Hz and the loads of 80 kN, 120 kN and 160 kN.\n3. For modular strip seal joints the manufacturer shall produce a test report from a recognized laboratory that the wearing of sliding interface of bearings of modular joints has been tested for a total sliding distance of 5000 m at a load of 48 kN.\n4. For modular strip seal joints the manufacturer shall also produce a test report from a recognized laboratory that the sliding material of sliding springs of expansion joints has been tested for a total sliding distance of 20,000 m with a load equivalent to a stress of 30 MPa.\n5. For modular strip seal joints the manufacturer shall also produce a test report from a recognised laboratory that the butt-welded splicing of centre beams has been tested with two million load cycles with a load equivalent to a stress of 165 MPa.\n6. In case of reinforced elastomeric joints abrasion resistance test shall be carried out in accordance with IS:3400 (Part 3) or DIN 53516.\n\n# 2612.2 Pre-installation Criteria\n\nThe pre-installation criteria shall include the routine tests and acceptance tests as described below:\n\n# 2612.2.1 Routine tests\n\nRoutine tests including tests for materials conforming to specifications shall be carried out by the original manufacturer i.e., in case of imported joints, by the foreign manufacturer as part of their quality control procedure for all joints to be supplied by them. Detailed documentation of all the tests and inspection data as per complete quality control procedure shall be supplied by the original manufacturer in the form of Quality Control Report. Routine tests shall include:\n\n- Raw materials inspection,\n\n745\n\nSection 2600\n# Expansion Joints\n\nProcess inspection, and complete dimensional check as per approved drawings.\n\n1.

Complete dimensional Check: Complete dimensional check of all components of joint as well as the assembled joint with respect to the approved drawings and tolerances as per these Specifications, shall be carried out by the manufacturer.\n\n# 2612.3 acceptance tests\n\n# 2612.3.1\n\nIn addition to the tests specified under Clause 2612.1, the manufacturer as well as the local supplier in case of imported joints shall have complete in-house testing facilities for the following tests. The Engineer shall insist upon these tests before acceptance of the joint.\n\n1. Cyclic Motion: Cyclic motion test may be carried out once on one complete joint assembly or one meter sample piece selected at\n\n746\n\n# Expansion Joints\n\n# Section 2600\n\nrandom from the entire lot of supply for each type of joint irrespective of movement capacity. The test sample shall be subjected to 5000 expansion and contraction cycles at minimum 30 cycles per hour. The test movement shall be 10 percent more than the design expansion/contraction movement. Any sign of distress or permanent set of any component or the assembly due to fatigue, will lead to rejection of entire lot of supply.\n\n1. Ponding: Prior to acceptance, 25 percent of the completed and installed joints, subject to a minimum of one joint, shall be subjected to water tightness test. Water shall be continuously ponded along the entire length for a minimum period of 4 hours for a depth of 25 mm above the highest point of deck. The width of ponding shall be at least 50 mm beyond the anchorage block of the joint on either side. The depth of water shall not fall below 25 mm anytime during the test.

The pumps shall be stopped and the gauge pressure shall not drop below 4 MPa within 2 minutes.\n\nThe pressure test shall be run for each injection unit at the beginning and after break of every shift.\n\n# b) Ratio Test\n\nThe mixing head of the injection equipment shall be disconnected and the two adhesive components shall be pumped simultaneously through the ratio check device, which shall consist of two independent valved nozzles. There shall be a pressure gauge capable of controlling back pressure by opening or closing valved nozzles capable of sensing the back pressure behind each valve. The discharge pressure shall be adjusted to read 5 bar for both adhesive components, which shall be simultaneously discharged into separate calibrated containers during the same time period. The amounts thus discharged shall be compared to determine whether the volume/discharge conforms to the manufacturer\u2019s recommended ratio for applicable material.\n\n# 2804 REPLACEMENT OF SPALLED CONCRETE BY EPOXY MORTAR/POLYMER MORTAR\n\n# 2804.1 Epoxy Mortar\n\n# 2804.1.1 Material\n\nThe epoxy resins for use in the mortar shall be obtained from a reputed manufacturer and shall conform to the following:\n\n- Pot Life: 60 minutes at 30\u00baC\n- Bond Strength: 12 MPa\n- Tensile Strength: 16 MPa\n\nThe Contractor/user shall carry out tests on the samples to demonstrate that the above requirements are met.\n\nThe sand to be used in the mortar shall be graded quartz sand.\n\n# 2804.1.2 Proportioning and Mixing\n\nThe resin and hardener shall be first mixed. Thereafter, dry filler shall be added and again mixed thoroughly. The resultant mix shall be free of lumps of dry filler and shall be of uniform.\n\n\n\nSection 2800                                                            Repair of Structures\n\nFor a total weight of 1kg or less, the components shall be mixed for 3 minutes in a slow speed (400-600 rpm) mixer. The stirrer shall be moved up and down and along the sides until uniform colour without streaks, is obtained. While stirring, it shall be ensured that excessive amount of air is not entrapped. If no power is available, a flat putty knife may be used to reach into the corners of the can and hand mixing done for at least 5 minutes.\n\n# 2804.1.3        Surface Preparation\n\nTwo general methods of surface preparation shall be followed:\n\n- a) Mechanical that includes grinding, grit blasting, water blasting and scarification.\n- b) Chemical that includes acid etching with 15 percent by weight of hydrochloric solution, followed by repeated flushing with high pressure stream of water.\n\nContaminants, such as oil, grease, tar, asphalt, paint, wax, curing compounds, surface; impregnants like linseed oil or silicons and laitance, loose material and unsound concrete, shall be removed from the surface on which epoxy mortar is to be placed.\n\n# 2804.1.4        Application\n\nThe epoxy primer coat which acts as a bonding agent, shall consist of resin and hardener mixed in the proportions as given by the manufacturer. Epoxy bonding agent shall be applied only on a dry surface and shall not be applied when it rains or in standing water. The overlay, whether epoxy or cement based, shall be done within the pot life of the epoxy primer coat. Epoxy primer coat shall be applied with the help of stiff nylon bristle brushes or hard rubber rollers or spray gun, depending upon the nature of surface and extent of work area. As far as possible, the coating shall be uniformly thick.\n\nBefore the primer coat is fully cured, epoxy mortar shall be applied by means of trowels and floats. The interval between the application of primer coat and epoxy mortar shall be approximately 15/30 minutes depending upon the ambient temperature. Seal coat shall be applied 24 hours after curing and mild roughening of the surface of the mortar.\n\n# 2804.1.5        Coverage\n\nThe coverage of resin mix would depend on the system of resin used. However, as a general guideline the coverage area shall be as under:\n\n- a) Primer Coat. An area of 3-6 square metres will be covered by 1 kg of resin hardener mix, depending on the finish of the concrete.\n\n766\n\nRepair of Structures\n# Section 2800\n\nb) Epoxy Mortar. One square metre of surface requires approximately 20-24 kg of epoxy mortar, when laid to a thickness of 10 mm.\n\nc) Seal Coat. An area of 4 to 6 square metres will be covered by 1 kg depending on the temperature of application.\n\n# 2804.1.6 Cleaning and Maintenance of Equipment\n\nTools and equipment are best cleaned immediately after use since the removal of cured resin is difficult and time consuming. The bulk of resin shall be removed using a scraper and remainder washed away completely using solvents such as toluene, xylene or acetone. Equipment shall always be cleaned before the epoxy hardens. Solvents used for this purpose may be Acetone (flammable), Methyl Ethyl Kethone (flammable), Methyl Chloride (non-flammable). Cured epoxies may be removed using Methylene Chloride.\n\n# 2804.1.7 Testing\n\nEpoxy used for making mortar shall conform to all requirements and testing procedures as laid down in Clause 2803.9.\n\n# 2804.1.8 Personnel and Environment Safety\n\nAny skin contact with epoxy materials, solvents and epoxy strippers should be avoided. Epoxy resins and particularly epoxy hardeners (B component) may cause a rash on the skin. The official toxicity classification on the container labels may be looked at before starting work.\n\nRubber gloves, with a cloth liner, and protective clothing shall be worn. Barrier creams are recommended but are not substitutes for protective clothing. Eyes shall be protected where splashing could occur while spraying or mixing. Good ventilation shall be ensured and inhalation of vapours avoided. If materials are sprayed, a respirator shall be used.\n\nIf contact occurs with the skin, it shall be immediately washed with a cleaner, followed by soap and water. Should eye contact occur, it shall be flushed immediately with plenty of water for 15 minutes and a doctor called for.\n\nIf contact occurs with the clothing, it shall be immediately changed to prevent further skin contact, and if the contact occurs with components A or B, the clothing shall be thrown away. Hardened epoxy is not harmful but will break the clothing.\n\nAll emptied, used buckets, rags and containers shall be removed from site. These shall be stored in waste disposal bags and suitably disposed of.\n\n767\n\nSection 2800 Repair of Structures\n\n# 2804.2 Polymer Mortar\n\n# 2804.2.1 Material\n\nThe latex acrylic polymer for use in the polymer modified cementitious mortar (PMC) shall be obtained from a reputed manufacturer and shall conform to the following:\n\n| Pot Life                           | 60 minutes at 30\u00baC     |\n| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------- |\n| Compressive strength at 28 days    | 18.20 N/mm\u00b2            |\n| Flexural strength at 28 days       | 3.0 N/mm\u00b2 to 5.0 N/mm\u00b2 |\n| Addition to concrete (slant shear) | 3.0 N/mm\u00b2 to 5.0 N/mm\u00b2 |\n\nThe sand to be used in the mortar shall be graded quartz sand and the sand content shall be in accordance with the desired consistency.\n\n# 2804.2.2 Proportioning and Mixing\n\nA dry mortar of quartz sand and cement (OPC) shall be prepared as per the proportions recommended by the manufacturer. The quantity of polymer shall be measured by measuring jars and shall be added to dry mortar. It shall be mixed with trowel or by hand so that no lumps remain in the mixed mortar.\n\n# 2804.2.3 Surface Preparation\n\nSame as in Clause 2804.1.3.\n\n# 2804.2.4 Application\n\nThe polymer bond coat shall consist of a mix of polymer and cement as per recommendations of manufacturer and shall be applied in the same manner as indicated in Clause 2804.1.4 for epoxy primer coat.\n\nThe cement and sand shall be dry mixed and then mixed with liquid polymer, adding the required amount of water in prescribed proportions as per manufacturer\u2019s recommendation. The mortar shall be mixed till it attains a smooth consistency. The mix shall be applied over the polymer bond coat by hand and finished by trowel.\n\n# 2804.2.5 Coverage\n\n- An area of 3 to 4 square metres will be covered by 1 litre of polymer bond coat, depending on substrata conditions.\n- An area of 1 square metre of surface will be covered by approximately 21-22 kg of polymer mortar when laid to a thickness of 10 mm.\n\n768\n\nRepair of Structures\n# Section 2800\n\n# 2804.2.6 Testing\n\nThe polymer used in making polymer mortar shall be tested for all requirements as indicated by the manufacturer and to satisfy requirements given in Clause 2804.2.1.\n\n# 2805 EPOXY BONDING OF NEW CONCRETE TO OLD CONCRETE\n\n# 2805.1\n\nEpoxy resin used for bonding shall be obtained from a reputed manufacturer. The pot life of such bonding epoxy shall not be less than 60 minutes at normal temperature.\n\n# 2805.2\n\nThe entire surface of the existing concrete member should be thoroughly cleaned by wire brush and then with compressed air to remove dust and loose particles from the surface. Any crack or spalling of concrete shall be sealed by epoxy injection/epoxy mortar/grouting as decided by the Engineer. A coating of suitable epoxy resin at the rate of 0.8 kg/sq.m (minimum) should then be applied on the surface of the existing concrete members. Fresh concrete shall then be placed within the pot life of the resin system.\n\n# 2805.3 Testing\n\n# 2805.3.1\n\nEpoxy used for bonding work shall satisfy the criteria mentioned in Clause 2803.9.\n\n# 2805.3.2\n\nTwo concrete cubes of 150 mm size cast as per approved design mix shall be placed at a distance of 150 mm from each other, as shown in Fig. 3 of Appendix-2800/1. Epoxy resin system suggested for bonding new to old concrete shall be applied on the opposite faces of the cubes. Fresh cement concrete cube of grade as per approved design mix shall be cast with water cement ratio of 0.4 or less in the manner shown in Fig. 3 of Appendix 2800/1. The assembly shall be cured in water for 28 days and steel spacer removed thereafter. The cube assembly shall be subjected to compression load after 28 days of curing, thereby subjecting the bond to shearing load. Failure must not occur at this joint.\n\n# 2806 CEMENT GROUTING\n\n# 2806.1 Material\n\nGrouting shall normally be performed with a mixture of neat Portland cement and water. Other additives and admixtures may be added to improve the impermeability and strength, with the approval of the Engineer. The size of the particles and the consistency of the grout must be suited to the passageways it must follow. Neat grout will not flow freely into holes smaller.\n\n\n\nSection 2800 Repair of Structures\n\nthan about three times the largest cement particle. Except in large cavities where thick mortar can be placed, the sand should all pass the 28-mesh sieve and have a large portion passing the 50-mesh and 100-mesh sieves. The proportions of Ordinary Portland cement to sand will depend upon the size of the spaces to be filled and will vary from a neat grout to about 1:1 mix. The amount of water to be added depends upon the consistency required. Grouts with as little as 16 litres of water per bag of cement could be used and it should seldom be necessary to use more than 35 to 40 litres of water per bag of cement.\n\nWhere necessary and approved by the Engineer, additives and admixtures may be added to Portland cement grout mixtures for improving impermeability and strength, delaying the setting time, increasing flowability and minimizing segregation and shrinkage.\n\n# 2806.2 Preparation\n\nThe surface shall be cleaned with wire brush and compressed air. Thereafter holes of 15 mm dia and 150 mm to 200 mm deep may be drilled along the length of the cracks at a spacing of 500 mm by wet drilling using rotary percussion drills and nipples shall be inserted in these holes.\n\n# 2806.3 Proportioning, Mixing and Equipment for Grouting\n\nThe cement grout shall be mechanically mixed using a system of power-driven paddles of high speed centrifugal pump. The grout pump to be used shall permit close control of pressures to allow a flexible rate of injection with minimum clogging of valves and ports. The most satisfactory equipment for injecting grout is a pump of the double-acting flexible reciprocating type giving a steady flow. The grout pump shall be so placed as to reduce the waste in cleaning lines. It is preferable to put 50 percent or more of the mixing water into the mixer before adding the dry ingredients and then the remaining water. A continuous supply of grout is preferable to an intermittent one. Consistency of the grout may be determined by trials starting with thin grout i.e. about 40 litres of water per bag of cement and progressively decreasing the water content to about 15 litres per bag of cement.\n\nWhere the mixer and pump are combined in one unit, the dry material shall be screened before mixing. If the mixer and pump are in separate units, the grout shall pass through a screen before it enters the pump.\n\n# 2806.4 Application\n\nHighest practical pressure within the limits of 100 kPa - 400 kPa should be used in order to force the surplus water from the grout. As the pressure may be distributed hydraulically over considerable areas, vigilance must be exercised to prevent damage or needless waste of grout. Adequate precaution shall be taken to ensure that leakage of grout does not occur.\n\n770\n\nRepair of Structures\n# Section 2800\n\nPressure shall be steady to ensure a continuous flow of grout. Grouting shall not be continued till the hole consumes mix at the rate of not less than 30 litres in 20 minutes or until refusal at the grouting pressure of 400 kPa at any hole. Should the grout escape from an adjacent nipple, it should be plugged or capped. Any seam, crack or joint through which grout escapes shall be caulked with epoxy mortar as soon as thick grout appears.\n\n# 2806.5 Cleaning of Equipment\n\nAfter completion of each grouting operation or temporary shutdown, it is advisable to force clear water through the pump until the discharge line shows no colour, after which the pump covers shall be removed and the valve chambers thoroughly cleaned.\n\n# 2806.6 Testing\n\nPercolation test done at the end of grouting operation shall give a value of less than 2 lugions. For specialised treatment like polymer modified cementitious grout injection, manufacturer\u2019s literature and specification shall be followed.\n\n# 2807 GUNITING/SHOTCRETING\n\n# 2807.1\n\nThe gunite shall comprise 100 parts by weight of cement, 300 parts by weight quartz sand, 35-50 parts by weight water and 2 parts by weight approved quick setting compound. In general, dry mix shotcrete shall be used.\n\n# 2807.2\n\nOrdinary Portland cement conforming to IS:269 shall be used in guniting.\n\n# 2807.3\n\nSand for guniting shall comply with the requirements stipulated in IS: 383. In general, sand should neither be too coarse to increase the rebound nor too fine to increase the slump. Sand should preferably have moisture content between 3 to 6 percent.\n\n| IS Sieve Designation | Percent Passing the Sieve |\n| -------------------- | ------------------------- |\n| 4.75 mm              | 95\u2013100                    |\n| 2.36 mm              | 65\u201390                     |\n| 1.18 mm              | 45\u201375                     |\n| 600 micron           | 30\u201350                     |\n| 300 micron           | 10\u201322                     |\n| 150 micron           | 2\u20138                       |\n\n# 2807.4\n\nFor thick sections it may be advantageous to incorporate coarse aggregate in the mix provided adequate guniting equipment is available. Coarse aggregate, when used,\n\n\n\nSection 2800\n# Repair of Structures\n\nshall conform to grading given in Table-1 of IS:9012. The percentage of coarse aggregate may normally be kept as 20 to 40 percent of the total aggregate and the mix shall be suitably designed.\n\n# 2807.5 Water/cement ratio for guniting\n\nshall fall within the range of 0.35 to 0.50 by mass; wet enough to reduce the rebound. Drying shrinkage may be between 0.06 percent and 0.10 percent. The quick setting compound shall be added at the nozzle with water just before guniting.\n\n# 2807.6 Workmanship\n\nThe cement and sand shall be batched and mixed and conveyed through a hose pipe with the help of compressed air. A separate line shall bring the water under pressure. The cement, sand and water mix shall be passed through and intimately mixed in a special manifold and then projected at high velocity to the surface being repaired. The density of gunite shall not be less than 2000 kg/cu.m. The strength of gunite shall not be less than 25 MPa. For effective guniting, the nozzle shall be kept 600 mm to 1500 mm away from the surface, preferably normal to that surface. While enclosing reinforcement bars during repairs the nozzle shall be held closer at a slight angle and the mix shall be wetter than the normal.\n\n# 2807.7 Test panels\n\nsimulating actual field conditions shall be fabricated for conducting preconstruction testing. The procedure for testing the cubes or cylinders taken from the panels stipulated in Clause 6 of IS:9012 shall be followed.\n\n# 2807.8\n\nIt should be ensured from tests that strength of about 25 MPa at 28 days is available for the mortar/concrete mix.\n\n# 2807.9\n\nThe defective concrete shall be cut out to the full depth till sound concrete surface is reached. Under no circumstances should the thickness of concrete to be removed be less than clear cover to the main reinforcement. No square shoulders shall be left at the perimeter of the cut-off portion and all edges shall be tapered. Thereafter, all loose and foreign materials should be removed and the surface sand blasted to make it rough to receive shotcrete after applying a coat of epoxy bonding as per recommendation of the manufacturer at the rate of 1.0 kg per 1.5 sq.m. of surface area.\n\n# 2807.10\n\nThe exposed reinforcement shall be thoroughly cleaned free of rust, scales etc. by wire brushing. Wherever the reinforcements have been corroded, the same shall be removed and replaced by additional reinforcement. Before application of gunite, a coat of neat cement slurry should be applied on the surface of the reinforcement.\n\n# 2807.11\n\nSufficient clearance shall be provided around the reinforcement to permit encasement with sound gunite. Care shall be taken to avoid sand pockets behind the reinforcement.\n\n772\n\nRepair of Structures\n# Section 2800\n\n2807.12 A thickness of 25 mm to 40 mm of gunite can normally be deposited in one operation. If, for some reason, the total thickness is to be built up in successive operations, the previous layer should be allowed to set but not become hard before the application of the subsequent layer. Guniting shall always be done on a damp concrete surface.\n\n2807.13 Where required, welded wire fabrics 50 mm x 50 mm x No. 10 gauge shall be provided in the first layer of guniting. The fabric shall be tied properly. In case the damage to the concrete member is very deep, the specifications for guniting as well as requirement of placement of wire mesh, has to be decided as per field conditions.\n\n2807.14 The stipulations given in IS:9012 regarding application of gunite should be followed so as to keep the rebound to the minimum. The quality of guniting and workmanship shall be such that the percentage of rebound mentioned in IS:9012 can be adhered to. In no circumstances shall the rebound material be re-used in the work.\n\n2807.15 It would be desirable that green gunite is moistened for at least 7 days. Guniting work shall not be done during windy or rainy conditions.\n\n# 2808 PROTECTIVE SURFACE COATING OF CONCRETE BY ACRYLIC ELASTOMERIC COATING\n\n2808.1 The acrylic elastomeric coating shall be water based (solvent free), modified with selected mineral fillers applied over the prepared surface. The coating should have anti-carbonation and water vapor diffusion property and should be resistant to action of ultra violet (UV) radiation. It should be waterproof and capable of bridging crazings and cracks. The shelf life for such coatings shall not be more than 6 months.\n\n2808.2 It is necessary that the system should be capable of protecting the surfaces of pre-stressed and reinforced concrete members from all deleterious elements such as chlorides and sulphates. The protective treatment should allow excess water vapour in the concrete to evaporate out (breathing) without rupturing itself due to vapour pressure. The protective system itself should not deteriorate from exposure to UV rays and weathering. The acrylic elastomeric coating system shall satisfy the requirements given in Table 2800-2.\n\n| Sl.No. | Parameter        | Requirement      | Reference            |\n| ------ | ---------------- | ---------------- | -------------------- |\n| 1)     | Specific Gravity | 1.4\u00b10.05         | IS:345               |\n| 2)     | Solid contents   | 70\u00b13%            | IS:345               |\n| 3)     | UV resistance    | No colour change | ASTM-G-53/DIN-EN-773 |\n\n\nSection 2800 Repair of Structures\n\n| Sl.No. | Parameter                                                       | Requirement                                                                                       | Reference                 |\n| ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |\n| 4)     | IR-Spectrum                                                     | As per Acrylic Polymer standards                                                                  | IR-Spectrometer           |\n| 5)     | Adhesion with concrete                                          | 1.5 N/m\u00b2                                                                                          | ASTM-D-4541-02/ DIN500014 |\n| 6)     | Dry film thickness                                              | 200-225 Microns (for minimum 2 coats)                                                             |                           |\n| 7)     | Coverage                                                        | 400-450 gm /m\u00b2 (2 Coats)                                                                          |                           |\n| 8)     | Physical properties Diffusion resistance against carbon dioxide | Equivalent air layer thickness SDCO\u2082 shall be >50 m                                               | DIN 53122 Part \u2013I         |\n| 9)     | Diffusion resistance against water vapour                       | Equivalent air thickness SDH\u20820 <4 m                                                               | DIN 52615                 |\n| 10)    | Water proofing characteristics                                  | Percentage reduction in flux should be >50%                                                       |                           |\n| 11)    | Re-coatability                                                  | Min. 2h to 72 h or as per manufactures specification with the approval of the Engineer in charge. |                           |\n\nThe primer shall satisfy the following requirements:\n\n- System: Single component universal polymer primer\n- Base: Acrylic Resin dispersion\n- Curing: Air Curing\n- Colour: Milk white, transparent application\n- Shelf life: 6 months from date of manufacturing in tightly sealed container.\n- Coverage: 75 gm/m\u00b2 to 100 gm/m\u00b2 (depending upon smoothness and absorption of concrete surface)\n\n# 2808.3 Quality Assurance\n\nThe Acrylic elastomeric material should be tested in GOI accredited laboratories where such laboratories are available, otherwise in other standard laboratories where similar facilities exist for properties specified above. Random samples during execution shall be taken from consignments brought to site to verify that the test results match with the earlier certificates produced before approval of the product. Both the test results (prior to approval and during execution), shall conform to the requirements as per Table 2800-1, failing which the consignment shall be rejected. It shall be made mandatory that the stock register for the materials are maintained at site and signed by the Engineer periodically.\n\n774\n\nRepair of Structures\n# Section 2800\n\n# 2808.4 Surface Preparation\n\nThe work shall commence after carrying out any repair to the concrete surface as directed by the Engineer. The concrete surface shall be free from all adhesion inhibiting substances such as oil, grease release agents as well as laitance and dust. The surface shall be cleaned by wire brushing, mechanical scraping and any loose material shall be removed by chiseling with small hammer and washed with clean water. The substrata shall be structurally sound for effective bond of the acrylic polymer with the concrete surface. All pin holes shall be filled with non-shrink polymer modified fine repair mortar.\n\n# 2808.5 Application\n\nAfter preparing the surface and filling the pin holes, primer coat (75-100 gm/sq.m.) shall be applied with brush/lambskin roller/spray gun and shall be cured for 60 minutes or as specified by the manufacturer. Subsequently, 1\u02e2\u1d57 and 2\u207f\u1d48 coats of polymer coating shall be applied with brush/spray gun/roller keeping the time between coats not less than 2 h and not more than 72 h. Consumption per coat shall be 200-225 gm/m\u00b2. The total dry film thickness of the protective coating for all coats shall be in the range of 200-225 microns. The wet film thickness shall be measured at a number of selected locations at the time of application with painting gauges. For measuring the dry film thickness, suitably located painting gauge shall be used. At least one gauge shall be located on each face of superstructure in each span but not less than one gauge/100 sqm. For the given solid content in the application, the dry film thickness to wet film thickness ratio should be established by prior testing in the laboratory using appropriate panels like glass plates, flat concrete, steel plates (300 x 300 mm) with similar coatings.

RFCR and RFCH values mentioned in the above table are for 20\u2070C.\n\n# A2\n\n# SPACING AND LAYOUT OF REINFORCEMENT IN REINFORCED SOIL WALLS\n\n# A2-1.1\n\nThe spacing of reinforcement shall be established based on the design principles and standards as per provisions of Clause A1. However, in the actual layout of\n\nReinforced Soil\n# Section 3100\n\nReinforcing elements, the following shall be adhered to as provided in the guidelines of FHWA NHI-10-025.\n\n1. To provide a coherent reinforced soil mass, the vertical spacing of primary reinforcement shall not exceed 800 mm, in all types of reinforcement.\n2. For walls constructed with modular blocks and deriving their connection capacity by friction, and also for any other facia configurations, where connection capacity is by friction, the maximum vertical spacing of reinforcement shall be two times the block width (measured from front fact to back face of the block). Further, the maximum spacing of reinforcing elements shall not exceed 800 mm in all cases. The maximum height of facing left unreinforced a) above the uppermost reinforcing layer and b) below the lowest reinforcing layer, shall not exceed the width of the block (measured from the front face to back face of the block.)\n3. In case modular blocks are used for facia, no more than one intervening block shall be left without having primary reinforcement.\n4. In case of wraparound facings for walls, the maximum spacing of reinforcing elements shall not exceed 500 mm, to protect against bulging.\n5. Where panels are used, the maximum spacing of reinforcement shall not exceed 800 mm. The spacing of nearest reinforcing element shall be such that maximum height of facing above uppermost reinforcement layer and below the lower most reinforcement layer does not exceed 400 mm.\n6. Reinforcement spacings worked out from the design procedures shall be configured to fit the above parameters.\n\n# A2-1.2\n\nWhereas the role of the primary reinforcement is to carry the tensile forces in the reinforced fill, secondary reinforcement may be required to protect the slope face from local sloughing and instability depending upon the facia configuration adopted. Where secondary reinforcement is used, stability of the area near the slope face shall be checked separately.\n\nWhere metallic type facia elements are used, the lower part of the facia element may be extended into the fill to serve as a secondary reinforcement. In other types of facia, geogrids may also be used as a secondary reinforcement. The length of the secondary reinforcement shall be adequate to provide local stability in the vicinity of the slope face.\n\n# A3\n\n# REINFORCED SOIL SLOPES\n\n# A3-1.1\n\nReinforced soil slopes are used in a wide variety of situations, such as\n\n- Construction of new embankments\n- Widening of existing slopes.\n- To construct a reinforced slope above a reinforced soil wall.\n\n815\n\nSection 3100\n# Reinforced Soil\n\nReinforced slopes with face angle between 70\u00b0 and 45\u00b0 are classified as steep slopes and those with face angle flatter than or equal to 45\u00b0 are classified as shallow slopes.\n\n# Design\n\nThe design and spacing of reinforcement shall be established based on the design principles of Clause A1 and per the provisions in standards BS:8006-1-2010, FHWA-NHI-10-024 and FHWA-NHI-10-025. The design is mainly based on rotational stability analysis.\n\nSteep slopes require a suitable facing to hold the reinforcement in-place as well as to protect the slope from local instability adjacent to the face. In the case of flatter slopes also, facing may be called for. Depending upon the properties of the fill and local climatic conditions of the area, suitable slope protection measures need to be adopted.\n\nWhere wrap around facia, gabion facia, woven and welded wire mesh facia are used suitable batter needs to be given. This batter may also be achieved by means of providing stepped offsets in placing the facia elements.\n\n# A3-1.2 Facia\n\nFacing shall enable the construction within specified tolerances of vertical and horizontal alignment and it should perform over the design life. The facing system should be able to meet the functional requirements such as rigidity, flexibility, aesthetics, environmental considerations etc. depending on location, purpose and use of structure.\n\nFor reinforced soil slopes of permanent nature, the durability of basic material for facing shall be ensured. A suitable filter should be provided behind the woven or welded steel wire mesh elements when they are provided in wrap around form. For steeper slopes in high rainfall intensity and/or high seismicity areas, combination of woven and welded steel wire mesh elements with additional stiffening elements and filter cloth shall be used to achieve flexibility, erosion prevention and stiffness requirements.\n\nWhere geosynthetics are used as facing for permanent reinforced slope structures, outer facia elements are required to be protected against UV degradation from sunlight. When vegetation is used as the facia cover, the face should provide a suitable medium like coir or jute for the establishment and continued growth of vegetation. For a vegetated face, several interrelated aspects need to be considered, including the climate, water requirements of plants and water availability, site location aspect, altitude, amount and frequency of precipitation, exposure, form of facing and erosion resistance capability to ensure permanent vegetative covering throughout the design life. If the characteristics of back fill soil are not adequate to support vegetation, suitable top soil material may be placed at the front face separated from the fill by an appropriate separator.\n\nThe contractor shall provide facing for the reinforced soil slope as approved by the designer and shown in the drawing plan.\n\n816\n\n# Reinforced Soil\n\n# Section 3100\n\n# ANNEXURE TO SECTION 3100\n\n# LIST OF CODES USED IN THE TEXT\n\n| S.

Grouted nails are recommended for all types of soil nail walls applications; and in particular, for walls with vertical height more than 7 m. Driven nails shall only be used when wall heights are smaller (less than or up to 7.0 m). The major difference between the two is the pullout resistance of the soil nails and grouted soil nails are expected to have higher pull out resistance. Pull out test is desirable to check the values of pullout resistance which is useful in soil nail design.\n\n# 3202.2\n\nDrilled and grouted soil nails (or simply grouted nails), are approximately 75 mm to 200 mm diameter nail holes drilled in the soil mass to be retained, which shall be followed by placing of steel reinforcement bars (tendon) and the grouting of the drill hole.\n\n# 3202.3\n\nDriven soil nails are relatively small in diameter (20 mm to 25 mm) and are mechanically driven into the ground. They are usually spaced approximately 0.5 m to 1.0 m apart.\n\n# 3203 CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS\n\nFollowing covers the general materials required for the construction of typical soil nailing structure.\n\n# 3203.1 Reinforcement Bar (Nail or Tendon)\n\nThe reinforcing element (tendon) shall be high strength steel reinforcing bar conforming to IS:1786 with a characteristic tensile strength of 415 MPa or higher which may be threaded at one end. Minimum recommended diameter of reinforcement bar (tendon) is 16 mm.\n\n# 3203.2 Nail head\n\nThe nail head shall comprise of following main components: the bearing-plate, hex nut, and washers; and the headed-stud. The bearing plate with a central hole (with diameter greater than reinforcement bar) shall be of minimum Fe250 grade steel, typically square in shape with 200 to 250 mm side dimension and 19 mm thickness. Washers and nuts shall be made of steel with a grade consistent with that of the nail bar commonly of 415 MPa or higher. Nuts may be tightened with a hand-wrench. The headed-stud connection may consist of four headed studs welded near the four corners of the bearing plate to provide anchorage of the\n\n821\n\nSection 3200 Soil Nailing\n\nnail head into the permanent facing. For temporary walls, the bearing plate shall be on the outside face of the shotcrete facing.\n\n# 3203.3 Grout\n\nGrout for soil nails is required to fill the annular space between the nail bar and the surrounding ground, and for shotcreting of the temporary facing. Grout for soil nail walls is commonly a neat cement grout with the water/cement ratio typically ranging from 0.4 to 0.5. Grout mix shall be prepared in accordance with IS:9012. Grout shall have a minimum 28 days characteristic strength of 20 MPa. For filling up nail holes, grout shall be pumped shortly after the nail bar is placed in the drillhole to reduce the potential for hole squeezing or caving. In solid nail bar applications, the grout may be injected by tremie methods through a grout pipe, which is previously inserted to the bottom of the drillhole, until the grout completely fills the drillhole.\n\n# 3203.4 Centralizers\n\nCentralizers are devices made of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) or other synthetic materials that are installed at various locations along the length of each nail bar to ensure that a minimum thickness of grout completely covers the nail bar. Centralizers shall be installed at regular intervals, typically not exceeding 2.5 m, along the length of the nail and at a distance of about 0.5 m from each end of the nail.\n\n# 3204 FACING TYPES\n\nSoil nail walls are generally provided with two types of facings: (a) temporary facing and (b) permanent facing.\n\n# 3204.1 Temporary Facing\n\nTemporary facing shall be constructed by providing reinforcement in the form of welded wire mesh (conforming to IS:1566) throughout the wall face, and by additional bearing plates (see Clause 3203.2.) and waler bars (rebars of smaller lengths placed in the vicinity of nail head) at the nail heads; which is, subsequently shotcreted in accordance with IS:9012. Overall temporary facing thickness shall vary from 75 mm to 200 mm.\n\n# 3204.2 Permanent Facing\n\nPermanent facing may be constructed as cast-in-place reinforced cement concrete conforming to IS:456, precast concrete or any suitable material to achieve desired strength and aesthetics. Reinforcement in the permanent facing may be adopted in the form of welded wire mesh or reinforcement bars in either direction. Permanent facing shall be connected to the temporary facing by means of headed-studs (usually four numbers per plate) welded on the bearing plates installed during construction temporary facing. Minimum thickness of permanent facing shall not be less than 200 mm.\n\n822\n\nSoil Nailing\n\n# Section 3200\n\n# 3205 CONSTRUCTION SEQUENCE\n\n3205.1 Typical sequence of construction of a soil nail wall shall be in accordance with following steps:\n\n1. Excavation of initial cut of 1.0 m to 2.0 m depending upon the capacity of in-situ soil to stand unsupported for about 12-24 hrs;\n2. Drilling hole for nail;\n3. Installation of nails followed by grouting and placing of drainage strip;\n4. Placing of construction facing and installation of bearing plates;\n5. Repetition of process till final level is reached; and\n6. Placing of final facing.\n\n# 3206 GEOTECHNICAL ASPECTS\n\n# 3206.1 Soil Investigation\n\nFor soil nail walls more than 30 m long, exploratory borings should be spaced between 30 to 60 m along the proposed centerline of the wall. For walls less than 30 m long, at least one boring is necessary along the proposed centerline of the wall. Borings are also necessary in front and behind the proposed wall. Borings behind the wall should be located within a distance up to 1 to 1.5 times the height of the wall behind the wall and should be spaced up to 45 m along the wall alignment. Borings in front of the wall should be located within a distance up to 0.75 times the wall height in front of the wall and should be spaced up to 60 m along the wall alignment. The depth of borings should extend at least one full wall height below the bottom of the excavation.\n\n# 3206.2 Bond Strength\n\nThe bond strength is the mobilized shear resistance along the soil-grout interface. The bond strength adopted for the design of soil nails is commonly based on conservative estimates obtained from field correlation studies and local experience in similar conditions. Consequently, some percentage of the soil nails shall be load tested according to standard procedure (pullout tests) in the field to verify bond strength design.\n\n# 3206.3 Suitable In-Situ Ground Conditions\n\nFollowing are the in-situ conditions considered favorable for the prospective use of soil nailing technique.\n\n- Soil shall be able to stand unsupported to a depth of about 1 m \u2013 2 m high vertical or nearly vertical cut for 12-24 hours.\n\n                                             823\n\nSection 3200 Soil Nailing\n\nb) Groundwater table shall be sufficiently below level of the lowermost soil nail at all cross-sections.\n\nc) Favorable soils: Stiff to hard fine \u2013grained soils, dense to very dense granular soils with some apparent cohesion, weathered rock with no weakness planes and glacial soils.\n\n# 3207 ANALYSIS OF FAILURE MODES\n\n# 3207.1\n\nAnalysis of various failure modes of soil nail structures shall be performed using allowable stress design methodology in accordance with IRC publication \u201cInterim Guidelines for Soil Nailing Technique in Highway Engineering Applications\u201d or any other state-of-art standard for analysis, design and construction of soil nail walls. For rigorous analyses, use of computational tools based on advanced numerical techniques such as finite element method, is strongly recommended.\n\n# 3208 INITIAL DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS\n\n# 3208.1 Wall layout\n\nEstablish the layout of the soil nail wall, including: (1) wall height; (2) length of the wall; (3) backslope; and (4) wall face batter. Wall face batter typically ranges from 0\u00ba to 10\u00ba. The evaluation of the wall layout also includes developing longitudinal profile of the wall, locating wall appurtenances (e.g., traffic barriers, utilities, and drainage systems), and establishing ROW limitations.\n\n# 3208.2 Soil Nail Vertical and Horizontal Spacing\n\nTypically, same nail spacing can be adopted in both horizontal S\u2095 and vertical Sv directions. Nail spacing ranges from 1.25 to 2 m (commonly 1.5 m) for conventional drilled and grouted soil nails, and as low as 0.4 m for driven nails. As a general rule, soil nail spacing in horizontal and vertical direction must be such that each nail has an influence area S\u2095 \u00d7 Sv \u2264 4m\u00b2.\n\n# 3208.3 Soil Nail Pattern on Wall Face\n\nThe soil nail pattern on wall face may be adopted as one of the following: (1) square (or rectangular); (2) staggered in a triangular pattern; and (3) irregular (at limited locations) depending upon the ease of construction and site-specific constraints.\n\n# 3208.4 Soil Nail Inclination\n\nSoil nails are typically installed at an inclination ranging from 0 to 30 degrees from horizontal with a typical inclination of 10-25 degrees.\n\n824\n\nSoil Nailing\n\n# 3208.5 Soil Nail Length and Distribution\n\nThe distribution of soil nail lengths in a soil nail wall can be selected as either uniform (i.e., only one nail length is used for the entire wall), or variable, where different nail lengths may be used for individual soil nail levels within a wall cross section. Uniform nail pattern is recommended for most applications.\n\n# 3209 OTHER DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS\n\n# 3209.1 Loads and Load Combinations\n\nSoil nail walls used on typical highway projects are typically subjected to the following different loads during their service life: (i) Dead loads DL (e.g., weight of the soil nail wall system, lateral earth pressure, weight of a nearby above-ground structure); (ii) Live loads LL (e.g., traffic loads); (iii) impact loads IL (e.g., vehicle collision on barriers above soil nail wall); and (iv) earthquake loads EQ. Following load combinations are recommended to assess the most critical loading condition:\n\n- (a) DL + LL\n- (b) DL + LL + IL\n- (c) DL + EQ\n\nFor earthquake loads, allowable stresses shall be increased by 133 percent from the values obtained with factors of safety for static loads.\n\n# 3209.2 Permissible Soil Nail Wall Deformations\n\nThe maximum permissible lateral deformation at the top of the soil nail walls constructed in weathered rock and stiff soils is 0.1%H; sandy soils is 0.2%H and for fine-grained soils is 0.3%H. Under no circumstances maximum permissible lateral deformation shall exceed 0.3%H, where: H is the vertical height of the soil nail wall. Permissible vertical deformation (i.e., settlement) shall be considered to be same as the permissible horizontal deformation.\n\n# 3209.3 Drainage Measures\n\n# 3209.3.1 Short Term Drainage Measures\n\nSurface water and groundwater must be controlled both during and after construction of the soil nail wall. A surface water interceptor ditch, excavated along the crest of the excavation and lined with concrete, is a recommended element for controlling surface water flows. Additionally, if ground water impacts are temporary or localized, suitable dewatering measures may be taken for lowering the groundwater table:\n\n825\n\n\n\nSection 3200 Soil Nailing\n\n# 3209.3.2 Long Term Drainage Measures\n\nLong term drainage shall be provided by means of the drainage system comprising of:\n\n1. vertical geo-composite drain strips placed suitably along the face of wall;\n2. weep holes in the form of perforated PVC pipes of typical diameter as 50-100 mm and 300-600 mm length, placed through the face at the location of expected localised seepage;\n3. provision of horizontal or slightly inclined drain pipes of typical diameter 50 mm installed at the locations where it is necessary to control the groundwater pressures imposed on the retained soil mass;\n4. installation of permanent interception ditch behind the wall at its crest to prevent surface water runoff from infiltrating behind the wall or flowing over the wall edge; and\n5. provision of a vegetative protective cap/cover to reduce or prevent water infiltration into the soil.\n\n# 3209.4 Corrosion Protection\n\nCorrosion potential of the soil must be evaluated for all permanent soil nail walls and, in some cases, for temporary walls.\n\nCorrosion protection measures:\n\n1. Specify a minimum grout cover of 25 mm between the reinforcement nail bar and the soil;\n2. recommend epoxy coating of minimum thickness 0.4 mm on the nail bars shall be applied by the manufacturer prior to shipment of nails to the construction site, which is, subsequently to be encased in grout cover;\n3. adopt other site-specific suitable corrosion protection measures.\n\n# 3210 FIELD PULLOUT TESTING\n\n# 3210.1\n\nField pullout testing of soil nails shall be conducted (a) to verify that the nail design loads can be carried without excessive movements and with an adequate safety factor for the service life of the structure, and (b) to verify the adequacy of the contractor\u2019s drilling, installation, and grouting operations prior to and during construction of production soil nails.\n\n# 3210.2 Types of Field Pullout Tests\n\nDepending upon the type of test being performed, the maximum test load, the load increments, and the time that each load increment is held shall be determined. To prevent chances of explosive failure of the steel, in no case, the soil nail tendon be stressed to more than 80 percent of its minimum ultimate tensile strength for grade Fe415 steel, or more than 90 percent of the minimum yield strength for grade Fe500 steel.\n\n826\n\nSoil Nailing\n# 3210.2.1 Verification Test\n\nA verification test on soil nail is performed: (a) to determine the ultimate bond capacity (if carried to pullout failure); (b) verify the design bond factor of safety, and (c) to determine the soil nail load at which excessive creep occurs. Verification tests are generally conducted on non-production \u201csacrificial\u201d nails as a first order of work prior to construction.\n\n# 3210.2.2 Proof Test\n\nA proof test is typically performed on a specified number of the total number of production soil nails installed. Typically, successful proof tests shall be performed on 5 percent of the production nails in each row or a minimum of 1 test per row. Proof tests provide information necessary to evaluate the ability of production soil nails to safely withstand design loads without excessive structural movement or long-term creep over the structure\u2019s service life.\n\n# 3210.2.3 Creep Test\n\nCreep tests are generally performed as part of a verification or proof test to ensure that nail design loads can be safely carried throughout the structure service life.\n\n# 3211 MEASUREMENT FOR PAYMENT\n\nMeasurements for earthwork shall conform to IS:1200(Part I), concrete work shall conform to IS:1200(Part II) and steelworks shall conform to IS:1200(Part VIII).

A sample of pulverised soil approximately 1kg in weight should be taken and weighed (W\u2081).\n2. It should be spread on the sieve and shaken gently, care being taken to break the lumps of soils as little as possible. Weight of soil retained on the sieve should be recorded (W\u2082). Lumps of finer soils in the retained material should be broken until all the individual particulars finer than the aperture size of the sieve are separated.\n3. The soil should again be placed on the sieve and shaken until sieving is complete. The retained material should be weighed (W\u2083).\n4. Weight of soil by percent passing the sieve can then be calculated from the expression:\n\n(W\u2081 \u2212 W\u2082) \u00d7 100\n\n(W\u2081 \u2212 W\u2083)\n\n847\n\nAppendices\n# Appendix 4\n\n# (Refer clause 509.2.4)\n\n# Anti-stripping Agents Used for Bituminous Materials and Mixes\n\n# 1. Scope\n\n1.1 Anti-stripping agents are used for bituminous materials and mixes to ensure adhesion between aggregates (hydrophilic in nature) and bitumen, even under submergence in water. Prior approval of the Engineer shall be taken in respect of both qualitative and quantitative use of a particular product.\n\n# 2. Materials\n\n2.1 The anti-stripping agents shall be fatty acid amines having a long hydrocarbon chain.\n\n2.2 Physical and Chemical Requirements: The anti-stripping agents shall conform to the physical and chemical requirements as detailed in Table A4-1.\n\n2.3 Storage and Handling: Anti-stripping agents shall be properly stored in closed containers made of steel or aluminium. Containers made of zinc, copper, polythene, PVC and most types of rubber are not suitable for use. As most of the anti-stripping agents cause irritation when in contact with human skin and are also irritating to the eyes, protective gloves for hands and goggles for the eyes shall be used while handling them, specially in case of liquid anti-stripping agents.\n\n# 3. Use in Sprayed Work\n\n3.1 Additive dosage: The dosage shall be determined depending on the nature (stripping value) of the aggregate and the size of aggregate. While the recommended minimum dose of anti-stripping agent for sprayed work is given in Table A4-2, the actual dosage shall be determined in the laboratory as directed by the Engineer.\n\n3.2 Mixing procedure during construction: The anti-stripping agent supplied in liquid, solid or concentrate form shall be thoroughly mixed with liquid bituminous material or with straight run bitumen. When used with straight run bitumen, the correct dose of anti-stripping agent shall be mixed in a hot bitumen tank boiler. The two constituents shall be agitated till the anti-stripping agent is thoroughly mixed. The dose of anti-stripping agent shall suitably be increased if the binder is to remain in bitumen boiler for a longer period.\n\n# 4. Use in Premix Work\n\n4.1 Additive dosage: The dosage shall be determined depending on the nature (stripping value) of the aggregate and the percent voids in the mix. While the recommended minimum doses for different types of bituminous premix materials in terms of voids content are given in Table A4-3, the actual dosage shall be determined in the laboratory as directed by the Engineer.\n\n848\n\nAppendices\n# Table A4-1 Specification for Antistripping Compound\n\n| s.no. | Test                                                                                          | Method                          | Limit                                        |\n| ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |\n| 1.    | Appearance                                                                                    | Visual                          | Liquid/Solid                                 |\n| 2.    | Odour                                                                                         | Smelling                        | Agreeable                                    |\n| 3.    | Specific gravity 27\u00baC                                                                         | IS:1202-1978                    | 0.860-1.03                                   |\n| 4.    | Pour point \u00baC Maximum                                                                         | IS:1448                         | 42                                           |\n| 5.    | Flash Point \u00ba(COC) Minimum                                                                    | IS:1448                         | 150                                          |\n| 6.    | Water Content percent Vol. Maximum                                                            | IS:1448                         | 1.0                                          |\n| 7.    | Solubility in diesel oil (HDO or LDO) in the ratio of 2:98 at 50\u00baC                            | As given at the end of Appendix | Complete                                     |\n| 8.    | Total base value mg KOH/g minimum                                                             | ASTM D 664                      | 200                                          |\n| 9.    | Nitrogen content percent Wt. minimum                                                          | Elemental Analyser              | 7.0                                          |\n| 10.   | Stripping value with bitumen containing 1 percent Wt. antistripping compound at 40\u00baC 24 hours | IS:6241                         | As given at the end of Appendix No stripping |\n| 11.   | Under water coating test                                                                      | - do -                          | Complete Coating                             |\n| 12.   | Thermal stability at 163\u00baC 5 hours                                                            | - do -                          | Should not lose its efficacy                 |\n| 13.   | Boiling water test percent minimum coating                                                    | ASTM D 3625                     | 95                                           |\n| 14.   | Retained Marshall Stability percent minimum                                                   | As given at the end of appendix | 75                                           |\n\n849\n\nAppendices\n\n# Table A4-2 Tentative Recommended Minimum dose of Antistripping Agent for sprayed Work\n\n| Aggregate stripping value                 |                                         | dose of antistripping agent in percent by weight of bitumen |                  |     |\n| ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- | --- |\n| surface dressing with precoated aggregate | pentration Macadam/Built up spray grout | surface dressing with uncoated aggregate                    | Liquid seal coat |     |\n| 0-25                                      | 0.5                                     | 0.6                                                         | 0.7              | 0.8 |\n| 25-50                                     | 0.6                                     | 0.7                                                         | 0.8              | 1.0 |\n| 50-100                                    | 0.75                                    | 1.0                                                         | 1.0              | 1.0 |\n\n# 4.2 Mixing procedure during construction\n\nThe required dose of the anti-stripping agent shall be poured into hot bitumen tank and allowed 15 to 30 minutes of circulation or stirred to ensure a homogeneous mix. It is necessary to use a stable antistripping agent or increase the dose according to expected degradation. Alternatively, the correct dose shall be injected into the bitumen line by means of a pump. The agent is fed into the bitumen first before it is sprayed on the aggregate in the mix; thus, no separate mixing time for mixing the agent with bitumen is required. In rolled asphalt and bitumen mastic surfacing works, precoated chippings are pressed into the hard surface while the mix is still hot to make the newly laid surface skid resistant. These chippings shall be precoated with bitumen treated with antistripping compound.\n\n# Table A4-3 Tentative Recommended Minimum dose of Antistripping compound in Bitumen premix Works\n\n| stripping value of aggregate | dose of antistripping agent in percent by weight of bitumen |                             |     |\n| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- | --- |\n| voids content 3-5 percent    | voids content 5-10 percent                                  | voids content 10-15 percent |     |\n| 0-25                         | 0.3                                                         | 0.4                         | 0.5 |\n| 25-50                        | 0.4                                                         | 0.5                         | 0.6 |\n| 50-100                       | 0.6                                                         | 0.8                         | 1.0 |\n\n850\n\nAppendices\n# Annexure to the Appendix 4\n\n# Testing Procedure for Solubility of Antistripping Agent in Diesel Oil\n\nProcedure: 98 ml of diesel oil (HDO or LDO) and 2 ml of antistripping agent shall be taken in a measuring cylinder with stopper. The cylinder along with its contents shall be kept in a water bath, maintained at 50\u00ba + 1\u00baC for half an hour. It shall then be taken out from the water bath and shaken vigorously for 10 minutes. The stopper shall be removed and the cylinder kept in the water bath for half an hour and examined for separation or settlement.\n\nReporting of Results: An antistripping agent is reported to be completely soluble in diesel oil if no separation or settlement is observed for half an hour.\n\n# Testing Stripping Value of Aggregates Using Bitumen with Varying Percentages of Antistripping Agent\n\nProcedure: Coarse aggregate passing 19 mm sieve and retained on 13.2 mm sieve shall be washed and dried in an oven for 24 hours at 110\u00baC. Such dried 200 gms of coarse aggregates shall be heated at 149\u00baC and then mixed with 80/100 penetration grade bitumen 5 percent by weight of coarse aggregate heated up to 163\u00baC. The mixture shall be mixed thoroughly for uniform coating of aggregates by bitumen. The mix shall then be transferred to a 500 ml beaker and allowed to cool to room temperature. Distilled water shall be added in the beaker, which shall be placed in a water bath maintained at 40\u00ba \u00b1 1\u00baC for 24 hours. The percentage degree of stripping shall be assessed visually. The test shall also be conducted with water containing 1 percent Sodium Chloride, as a precautionary measure to eliminate water contamination. The test is repeated using bitumen containing up to one percent of antistripping agent in stages of 0.25 percent.\n\n# Testing Efficacy of Antistripping Agent to Coat Aggregates with Bitumen in Presence of Water\n\nProcedure: The antistripping agent shall be added in percent contents of 0.0, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1.00 and 1.25 to cutback bitumen MC3 (4 parts of bitumen 80/100 and 1 part of kerosene oil). The blends shall be used for testing their ability to coat the road aggregates under water.\n\n(a) 100 gm of clean and dry stone dust conforming to the following gradation shall be taken:\n\n| sieve size | percent passing |\n| ---------- | --------------- |\n| 2.36 mm    | 100             |\n| 1.18 mm    | 80              |\n\n851\n\nAppendices\n\n600 mic. 75\n\n300 mic. 45\n\nThe bottle shall be filled to 3/4 of its volume with distilled water at 40\u00baC. The bitumen-antistripping agent blend shall be added in the bottle at the rate of 7.5 percent by weight of stone dust. The stopper shall be replaced and the bottle shall be vigorously shaken for two minutes. The water shall be then drained off and the stone dust shall be transferred to a piece of paper and examined visually for satisfying complete coating. The minimum percent content of antistripping agent at which the stone dust sample is thoroughly coated shall be recorded. The test shall be repeated at 60\u00baC in water as well as 1 percent solution of Sodium Chloride in water for both the testing temperatures.\n\n(b) The underwater coating test further be conducted with coarse aggregate, passing 19 mm sieve and retained on 13.2 mm sieve. In this case, the percent content of the cutback-antistripping agent blend shall be kept at 5 percent by weight of coarse aggregate. In order to take care of contamination in water, the test shall also be carried out in the 1 percent Sodium Chloride in water.\n\nThe minimum percent content of antistripping agent at which stone dust/coarse aggregate is thoroughly coated as per (a) and (b) shall be taken as the dose of antistripping agent.\n\n# Testing for Thermal Stability of Antistripping Agent\n\nProcedure: Blends of antistripping agent and bitumen of 80/100 grade shall be prepared with 0.00, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75 and 1.00 percent contents of antistripping agent and kept in oven at 163\u00baC for five hours. After the heat exposure, the blend samples are fluxed with kerosene oil to obtain the consistency of MC 3 and tested for underwater coating test.\n\nReporting of Test Results: An antistripping agent shall be deemed to be heat resistant if the dose requirement before and after heat exposure remains unchanged.\n\n# Quantitative Evaluation of Retained Marshall Stability Values After Immersion in Water\n\nProcedure: For Quantitative evaluation, the tests shall be carried out as stipulated in ASTM D1075 (Effect of Water on Cohesion of Compacted Bituminous Mixtures). The gradation of aggregates shall be such as to give sufficient voids in the compacted bituminous mix to bring out the effects of stripping. The gradation of aggregates shall be as under:\n\n852\n\n\n\nAppendices\n\n# Appendices\n\n| sieve size | percent passing |\n| ---------- | --------------- |\n| 19.00 mm   | 100             |\n| 13.20 mm   | 75-100          |\n| 9.50 mm    | 60-80           |\n| 4.75 mm    | 35-55           |\n| 2.36 mm    | 20-35           |\n| 600 mic    | 10-22           |\n| 300 mic    | 6-16            |\n| 150 mic    | 4-12            |\n| 75 mic     | 2-8             |\n\nThe Marshall test specimens shall be prepared using 5 percent bitumen of 80/100 grade by weight of aggregates blended with varying percentages of antistripping agents from 0 to 1 percent in steps of 0.25 percent. The test samples shall give a void content of about 6 percent. At least 8 standard Marshall specimens for each of the varying antistripping agent percentages shall be prepared. Each set of 8 test specimens shall be sorted out in two groups of 4 each so that the average specific gravity of the specimen in Group I shall be essentially the same as in Group II. Group-I shall be tested for Marshall Stability in the usual procedure ASTM D1559. Group-II specimens shall be immersed in water for 24 hours at 60\u00baC \u00b1 1\u00baC and then shall be tested immediately for Marshall stability as per ASTM D 1559.\n\ncalculation: The numerical index of resistance of bituminous mixtures to the detrimental effect of water shall be expressed as the index of retained stability:\n\nAverage Marshall Stability of Group-II\n\n______________________________________  x 100 percent\n\nAverage Marshall Stability of Group-I\n\nRequirement for Acceptance: A minimum of 75 percent of retained Marshall strength shall be required for acceptance.\n\n                                              853\n\nNO_CONTENT_HERE\n\nNO_CONTENT_HERE\n\nNO_CONTENT_HERE\n\nNO_CONTENT_HERE\n\nNO_CONTENT_HERE\n\nAppendices\n# Appendix \u2013 1500/i\n\n(Refer clause 1503.2)\n\n# inFORMATiOn TO Be sUppLied By THe MAnUFAcTUReRs OF pROpRieTARy sysTeMs\n\n# 1 geneRAL\n\n1.1 The information which the manufacturer is required to supply shall be in such detail as to obviate unsafe use of the equipment due to the intention of the manufacturer not having been made clear or due to wrong assumptions on the part of the user.\n\n1.2 The user shall refer unusual problem or problems of erection/assembly not in-keeping with the intended use of the equipment, to the manufacturer of the equipment.\n\n# 2 inFORMATiOn ReQUiRed\n\n2.1 The manufacturers of proprietary systems shall supply the following information:\n\n- a) Description of basic functions of equipment\n- b) List of items of equipment available, giving range of sizes, spans and such like, with the manufacturer\u2019s identification numbers or other references.\n- c) The basis on which the safe working loads have been determined and whether the factor of safety given applies to collapse or yield.\n- d) Whether the supplier\u2019s data is based on calculations or tests.

If additional/new joints are approved by the Engineer, the following considerations for their location shall be taken into account:\n\n- Joints shall be provided in non-aggressive zones or in non-splash zones. If not feasible, the joints shall be sealed.\n- Joints should be positioned where they are readily accessible for preparation and concreting, such as location where the cross-section is relatively small, and where reinforcement is not congested.\n- In beams and slabs, joints should not be near the supports. Construction joints between slabs and ribs in composite beams should be avoided.\n- For box girders, it is preferable to cast the soffit and the webs without any joint.\n- Location of joints shall minimize the effects of the discontinuity on the durability, structural integrity and the appearance of the structure.\n\n# Preparation of Surface of the Joint\n\nLaitance shall be removed before fresh concrete is cast. The surface shall be roughened. Care shall be taken that they should not dislodge the coarse aggregates. Concrete may be brushed with a stiff brush soon after casting while the concrete is still fresh.\n\nIf the concrete has partially hardened, it shall be treated by wire brushing or with a stiff water jet followed by drying with air jet immediately.\n\nFully hardened concrete shall be treated with mechanical hand tools or grit blasting, taking care not to split or crack aggregate particles.\n\nBefore further concrete is cast, the surface should be thoroughly cleaned to remove debris and accumulated rubbish, one effective method being by air jet.\n\nWhere there is likely to be a delay before placing the next concrete lift, protruding reinforcement shall be protected. Before the next lift is placed, rust, loose mortar or other contamination shall be removed from the reinforcements. In aggressive environment, the concrete shall be cut back to expose the reinforcements for a length of about 50 mm to ensure that contaminated concrete is removed.\n\n861\n\nAppendices\n# Appendices\n\n# Concreting of Joints\n\nThe joint surface shall not be contaminated with release agents, dust or curing membrane.\n\nThe old surface shall be thoroughly cleaned and soaked with water. Standing water shall be removed shortly before the new concrete is placed and the new concrete shall be thoroughly compacted. Concreting shall be carried out continuously up to the construction joints.\n\nSurface retarders may be used to improve the quality of construction joints.\n\nFor a vertical construction joint, a stopping board shall be fixed previously at the predetermined position and shall be properly stayed to prevent its displacement or bulging when concrete is compacted against it. Concreting shall be continued right up to the board.\n\n862\n\n# Appendix-1700-i : permeability Test\n\n# Appendices\n\n863\n\nAppendices\n# Appendix-1800/i\n\n(Refer clause 1805.6.2)\n\n# Tests On Sheathing Ducts\n\nAll tests specified below shall be carried out on the same sample in the order given below. At least 3 samples for one lot of supply (not exceeding 7000 metre length) shall be tested. The tests are applicable for sheathing transported to site in straight lengths when the prestressing cable is threaded inside the sheathing prior to concreting. These tests are not applicable for sheathing not for coiled cable and transported to site as an assembled unit, nor for sheathing ducts placed in position without threading of prestressing cable prior to concreting.\n\n# (A) Workability Test\n\nA test sample 1100 mm long is soldered to a fixed base plate with a soft solder (Fig.1800/i-1). The sample is then bent to a radius of 1800 mm alternately on either side to complete 3 cycles. Thereafter, the sealing joints will be visually inspected to verify that no failure/opening has taken place.\n\n# (B) Transverse Load Rating Test\n\nThe test ensures that stiffness of the sheathing is sufficient to prevent permanent distortion during site handling. The sample is placed on a horizontal support 500 mm long so that the sample is supported at all points of outward corrugations. A load as specified in Table 1 is applied gradually at the centre of the supported portion through a contact surface 12 mm long. It shall be ensured that the load is applied approximately at the centre of two corrugations, Fig. 1800/i-2.

This also covers some of the essential protective measures to be adopted for minimising corrosion in PSC bridges.\n\n1.2 The purpose of grouting is to provide permanent protection to the post-tensioned steel against corrosion and to develop bond between the prestressing steel and the surrounding structural concrete. The grout ensures encasement of steel in an alkaline environment for corrosion protection and by filling the duct space, it prevents water collection and freezing.\n\n# 2 MATeRiALs\n\n2.1 Water\nOnly clean potable water free from impurities conforming to section 1000 shall be permitted. No sea or creek water is to be used at all.\n\n2.2 cement\nOrdinary Portland cement should be used for preparation of the grout. It should be as fresh as possible and free of any lumps. Pozzolana cement shall not be used.\n\n2.3 sand\nIt is not recommended to use sand for grouting of prestressing tendons. In case the internal diameter of the ducts exceeds 150 mm, use of sand may be considered. Sand used, shall conform to IS:383 and shall pass through IS Sieve No. 150. The weight of sand in the grout shall not be more than 10 percent of the weight of cement, unless proper workability can be ensured by addition of suitable plasticizers.\n\n2.4 Admixtures\nAcceptable admixtures conforming to IS:9102 may be used if tests have shown that their use improves the properties of grout, i.e. increasing fluidity, reducing bleeding, entraining air or expanding the grout. Admixtures must not contain chlorides, nitrates, sulphides, sulphites or\n\n873\n\nAppendices\n\n# 2.5 Sheathing\n\n# 2.5.1 For specifications of sheathing\n\nSection 1800 may be referred.\n\n# 2.5.2 Grout openings or vents\n\n- a) All ducts should have grout openings at both ends. For this purpose special openings should be provided where such openings are not available at end anchorages. For draped (curved) cables vents shall be provided at all crown and valley points. It is a good practice to provide additional air vents at suitable intervals not exceeding 20 m. All grout openings or vents should include provisions for preventing grout leakage.\n- b) Standard details of fixing Couplers, inlets, outlets and air vents to the duct anchorage shall be followed as recommended by the supplier of the prestressing system.\n\n# 2.5.3 Ducts should be securely fastened\n\nAll unintended holes or openings in the duct must be repaired prior to concrete placing. The joints of the couplers and the sheathing should be made waterproof by use of adhesive tape or similar suitable system capable of giving leak proof joints. Grout openings and vents must be securely anchored to the duct and to either forms or to reinforcing steel to prevent displacement during concreting operations due to weight, buoyancy and vibrations.\n\n# 2.5.4 Ducts require very careful handling\n\nAs, being of thin metal, they are susceptible to leakage due to corrosion in transit or storage, by tearing/ripping in handling particularly when placed adjoining to reinforcing steel, by pulling apart at joints while inserting tendons prior to concreting, or by accidental puncturing while drilling for form ties/inserts. Ducts are also liable to damage by rough use of internal vibrator and sparks from welding being done close by.\n\n# 3 Equipment\n\n# 3.1 Grout Mixer and Agitator\n\nIt is essential that the grout is maintained in a homogeneous state and of uniform consistency so that there is no separation of cement. Use of grout mixers to obtain a colloidal grout is essential. The mixer should have an additional storage device with an agitator to keep the\n\n874\n\n# Appendices\n\n# 3.2 grout pump\n\nThe pump should be a positive displacement type and should be capable of ejecting the grout in a continuous operation and not by way of pulses. The grout pump must be fitted with a pressure gauge to enable pressure of injection to be controlled. The minimum pressure at which grout should be pumped shall be 0.3 MPa and the Grout Pump must have a relief arrangement for bypass of the grout in case of buried up of pressure beyond 1 MPA. The capacity of the grout pump should be such as to achieve forward speed of grout of around 5 to 10 metres per minute. The slower rates are preferable as they reduce the possibility of occurrence of voids. If the capacity of the pump is large, it is usual to grout two or more cables simultaneously through a common manifold.\n\nUse of hand pumps for grouting is not recommended. Use of compressed air operated equipment for injection is prohibited, as it is likely that there will be some air trapped in grout.\n\n# 3.3 Water pump\n\nBefore commencement of grouting, a stand by direct feed high pressure water pump should be available at site for an emergency. In case of any problem in grouting the ducts, such pump shall immediately be connected to the duct and all grout flushed by use of high pressure water flushing. It is, therefore, necessary to have adequate storage of clean potable water for operation of the water pump for such emergencies.\n\n# 3.4 grout screen\n\nThe grouting equipment should contain a screen having a mesh size of IS:106 (IS:105 if sand is used). Prior to introduction into the grout pump, the grout should be passed through such screen. This screen should be easily accessible for inspection and cleaning.\n\n# 3.5 connections and Air vents\n\nStandard details of fixing inlets, outlets and air vents to the sheathing and/or anchorage should be followed as recommended by specialist supplier of the system of prestressing. In general, all connections are to be of the \u201cQuake couple\u201d type and at change of diameters suitable reducers are to be provided.\n\nAppendices\n# 4 pROpeRTies OF THe gROUT\n\n# 4.1\n\nWater/Cement ratio should be as low as possible, consistent with workability. The ratio should not normally exceed 0.45. The temperature of the grout shall not exceed 25\u00baC.\n\n# 4.2\n\nBefore grouting, the properties of the grout mix should be tested in a laboratory depending on the facilities available. Test should be conducted for each job periodically. The recommended tests are described below:\n\n1. deleterious Materials\nNo chloride, sulphates shall be separately added to the grout. The constituent may contain chlorides/sulphates. However, its net effect should not exceed the following limits in the grout:\n\n- Chlorides (Cl) not more than 0.1 percent by weight of cement.\n- Sulphate (SO\u2083) not more than 4 percent by weight of cement.\n- Sulphide-ions(s) not more than 0.01 percent by weight of cement.\n2. compressive strength\nThe compressive strength of 100 mm cube of the grout shall not be less than 27 MPa at 7 days or 30 MPa at 28 days. Cubes shall be cured in a moist atmosphere for the first 24 hours and subsequently in water. These tests shall be conducted in advance to ascertain the suitability of the grout mix. The 7 day strength is not mandatory if the 28 day strength requirement is met.\n3. setting Time\nInitial setting time of grout shall be more than three hours and less than 12 hours. The final setting time shall not be less than 24 hours.\n4. Bleeding\nBleeding is the separation of free water from the grout mix. It includes the filtering effect of strands where the cavities between the wires constituting the strand, block cement particles and permit water under pressure to move ahead of the grout in the direction of general flow of grout. The bleeding shall be sufficiently low to prevent excessive segregation and sediment of the grout material. The bleeding shall not exceed 0.3 percent of volume of the initial volume of grout after three hours kept at rest.\n5. volume change\nThe volume change of grout kept at rest for 24 hours and tested as per ASTM C 1090 shall be within range of 1% and 5 % of the original volume.\n\n876\n\nAppendices\n\n# 4) Fluidity\n\nFluidity is tested as per ASTM C 939 standard using standard flow cone.\n\nNote: The fluidity of grout changes from time of mixing to time of setting in the ducts. The requirement given above may be modified as per the specific application, depending upon the total temperature, length of tendons, head of pumping, requirement of simultaneous grouting of closely spaced tendons etc. provided that other specifications and functions are satisfied.\n\n# 5 Mixing OF gROUT\n\n# 5.1\n\nProportions of materials should be based on field trials made on the grout before commencement of grouting, but subject to the limits specified above. The materials should be measured by weight.\n\n# 5.2\n\nWater should be added to the mixer, first, followed by Portland cement and sand, if used. Admixture if any, may be added as recommended by the manufacturer.\n\n# 5.3\n\nMixing time depends upon the type of the mixer, but will normally be between 2 and 3 minutes. However, mixing should be for such a duration as to obtain uniform and thoroughly blended grout, without excessive temperature increase or loss of expansive properties of the admixtures. The grout should be continuously agitated until it is injected.\n\n# 5.4\n\nOnce mixed, no water shall be added to the grout to increase its fluidity.\n\n# 5.5\n\nHand mixing is not permitted.\n\n# 6 gROUTing OpeRATiOns\n\n# 6.1 general\n\na) Grouting shall be carried out as early as possible but not later than 2 weeks of stressing a tendon. Whenever this stipulation cannot be complied with for unavoidable reason, adequate temporary protection of the steel against corrosion by methods or products which will not impair the ultimate adherence of the injected grout should be ensured till grouting. The sealing of the anchorage ends after concreting is considered to be a good practice to prevent ingress of water. For structures in aggressive environment, sealing of the anchorage ends is mandatory.\n\nNotes :\n\ni) Application of some patented water soluble oils for coating of steel/VPI powder injection/sending in of hot, dry, oil-free compressed air through the vents at frequent intervals have shown good results.\n\n877\n\nAppendices\nii) Some of the methods recommended for sealing of anchorages are to seal the openings with bitumen impregnated gunny bag or water proof paper or by building a brick pedestal plastered on all faces enclosing the exposed wires outside the anchorages.\n\niii) Any traces of oil if applied to steel for preventing corrosion should be removed before grouting operation.\n\niv) Ducts shall be flushed with water for cleaning as well as for wetting the surfaces of the duct walls. Water used for flushing should be of same quality as used for grouting. It may, however, contain about 1 percent of slaked lime or quick lime. All water should be drained thorough the lowest vent pipe or by blowing compressed air through the duct.\n\nv) The water in the duct should be blown out with oil free compressed air. Blowing out water from duct for cables longer than 50 m draped up at both ends by compressed air is not effective. Outlet/ vent provided at or near the lowest point shall be used to drain out water from duct.\n\nvi) The connection between the nozzle of the injection pipe and duct should be such that air cannot be sucked in.\n\nvii) All outlet points including vent openings should be kept open prior to commencement of injection grout.\n\nviii) Before grouting, all air in the pump and hose should be expelled. The suction circuit of the pump should be air-tight.\n\n# 6.2 Injection of Grout\n\n- a) After mixing the grout should be kept in continuous movement.\n- b) Injection of grout must be continuous and should not be interrupted.\n- c) For vertical cable or cables inclined more than 60 degrees to the horizontal, injection should be effected from the lowest anchorage or vent of the duct.\n- d) The method of injection should ensure complete filling of the ducts. To verify this it is advisable to compare the volume of the space to be filled by the injected grout with the quantity of grout actually injected.\n- e) Grouting should be commenced initially with a low pressure of injection of up to 0.3 MPa increasing it until the grout comes out at the other end. The grout should be allowed to flow freely from the other end until the consistency of the grout at this end is the same as that of the grout at the injection end. When the grout flows at the other end, it should be closed off and building up of pressure commenced. Full injection pressure at about 0.5 MPa shall be maintained for at least one minute before closing the injection pipe. It is recommended practice to provide a stand pipe at the highest point of the tendon profile to hold all water displaced by sedimentation or bleeding. If there is a built up of pressure much in excess of 1 MPa without flow of grout coming at the other end; the grouting operation should be discontinued and the entire duct flushed with high pressure water. Also, the bypass system indicated in para 3.2 above is essential for further safety.\n\n878\n\nAppendices\n\nf) In the case of cables draped downwards e.g. in cantilever construction simultaneous injection from both ends may be adopted. Fig. 1800/iii-1.\n\ng) Grout not used within 30 minutes of mixing should be rejected.\n\nh) Disconnection is facilitated if a short length of flexible tube connects the duct and injection pipe. This can be squeezed and cut off after the grout has hardened.\n\n# pRecAUTiOns And RecOMMendATiOns FOR eFFecTive gROUTing</h7>\na) In cold and frosty weather, injection should be postponed, unless special precautions are taken. If frost is likely to occur within 48 hours after injection, heat must be applied to the member and maintained for at least 48 hours after injection so that the temperature of the grout does not fall below 5 degrees Celsius. Prior to commencement of grouting, care must be taken to ensure that the duct is completely free of frost/ice by flushing with warm water, but not with steam.\n\nb) The temperature of the grout shall not exceed 25 degrees Celsius. For increasing the workability of grout, its temperature may be lowered by use of chilled water or by putting ice outside the grout storage container.\n\nc) When the cables are threaded after concreting, the duct must be temporarily stiffened during concreting by inserting bunch of strands, wires or reinforcement or a rigid PVC pipe or any other suitable method.\n\nd) During concreting, care shall be taken to ensure that the sheathing is not damaged. Needle vibrators shall be used with extreme care by well experienced staff only, to ensure against such damage.\n\ne) It is a good practice to move the cables in both directions during the concreting operations. This can easily be done by light hammering the ends of the wires/strands during concreting. It is also advisable that 3 to 4 hours after concreting the cable should be moved both ways through a distance of about 20 cms. With such movement, any leakage of mortar which has taken place in spite of all precautions, loses bond with the cables, thus reducing the chance of blockages. This operation can also be done by fixing prestressing jacks, at one end pulling the entire cable and then repeating the operation by fixing the jack at the other end.\n\nf) The cables to be grouted should be separated by as much distance as possible.\n\n879\n\n# Appendices\n\n# Fig. 1800/iii : procedure for grouting of cables draped downwards\n\n880\n\n# Appendices\n\ng) In case of stage prestressing, cables tensioned in the first stage should not remain ungrouted till all cables are stressed. It is good practice, while grouting any duct in stage prestressing, to keep all the remaining ducts filled up with water containing 1 percent lime or by running water through such ducts till the grout has set. After grouting the particular cable, the water in the other cables should be drained and removed with compressed air to prevent corrosion.\n\nh) Care should be taken to avoid leaks from one duct to another at joints of precast members in particular.\n\ni) End faces where anchorages are located are vulnerable points of entry of water. They have to be necessarily protected with an effective barrier. Recesses should be packed with mortar concrete and should preferably be painted with water proof paint.\n\nj) After grouting is completed, the projecting portion of the vents should be cut off and the face protected to prevent corrosion.\n\nAppendices\n# Appendix 1800/iv\n\n(Refer clause 1809)\n\n# gROUTing RecORd\n\nJob Name:\n\nSpan No.:\n\nCable No:\n\nDate of Cable Installation:\n\nDate of Grouting:\n\nType of Cement: OPC/II ISOPC\n\nWeek and Year of Manufacture of OPC/ IISOPC:\n\nW/C Ratio:\n\nName and amount of admixture used, if any:\n\nTemperature:\n\nMixing water:  ; Grout:\n\nTime: Start:  ; Finish:\n\nEquipment: Grout mixture:  ; Grout pump:\n\nCable duct: Diameter:  ; Length:\n\nVolume of grout in litres:\n\nRegrouting:\n\nGrouting pressure:\n\nCement consumption: Theoretical:  ; Actual:\n\n# Pre-grouting checks:\n\nFree of blockage\n\nInlet: Yes/No ; Outlet: Yes/No\n\nVents: Yes/No ; Cable duct: Yes/No\n\nLeakage observed: Yes/No ; Sealed: Yes/No\n\nIf cable duct blocked: Remedial Measures\n\n# Grouting observations:\n\nPassage of grout through vents: Yes/No\n\nPassage of grout through outlet: Yes/No\n\nAny equipment failure\n\n# Post grouting checks:\n\nProbbing by stiffwire:\n\nRemarks:\n\nSignatures of officers present during grouting:\n\nClient:\n\nContractor:\n\nSystem Supplier:\n\n882\n\n# Appendices\n\n# Appendix 2800\n\n(Refer clause 2803.9.1)\n\n# Fig. 2800/i\n\n# Fig. 2800/ii\n\n883\n\n# Appendices\n\n# Fig. 2800/iii\n\n884",

            "text": "# Preface to the Fifth Revision\n\nThis edition of the Specifications for Road and Bridge Works marks the Fifth Revision. In the last decade and a half, significant developments have taken place in the highways sector. The massive National Highways Development Projects (NHDP) undertaken by the Government of India is in progress involving execution of a large number of high value road projects. These require adoption of latest international practices so as to achieve technical excellence and the best quality. Concrete bridges have also undergone major changes with development of new structural forms, new methods of computer based analysis and design and development of high strength materials, IRC:112 for concrete bridges based on the limit state method has come into force. Over the past few years, many IRC codes have also been completely revised necessitating extensive changes in the Ministry\u2019s specifications for road and bridge works.\n\nSome of the important additions in this revision of Specifications for Road and Bridge Works cover stone mastic asphalt, microsurfacing, sand asphalt base course, prefabricated vertical drains (PVD), natural geo textiles, geo cells for use in base and sub base in pavement and slope protection, variable message sign boards, soil nailing, cold applied retro-reflective paints, audible and vibratory pavement markings, solar powered road markers, traffic control &#x26; safety devices in construction zone, traffic impact attenuators and advance traffic management system. Some of the new areas covered in bridges include high performance concrete, HDPE sheathings, Pot-PTFE bearings, jack down method of well sinking, dynamic testing of piles and mechanically woven wire crates for gabions.\n\nThe Fifth Revision of the Specifications for Road and Bridge Works is the result of the concerted efforts of the officers of the Roads Wing and other professionals who contributed to the drafting of this document. I wish to express my gratitude to all of them and the Indian Roads Congress for undertaking the assignment of bringing out this publication. Feedback and suggestion for further improvement would be welcome from users of this edition.\n\n(C. Kandasamy)\nDG(RD) &#x26; SS\n03-01-2013",

It shall include necessary excavation, backfilling of pits resulting from uprooting of trees and stumps to required compaction, handling, salvaging, and disposal of cleared materials with all leads and lifts. Clearing and grubbing shall be performed in advance of earthwork operations and in accordance with the requirements of these Specifications.\n\n# 201.2 Preservation of Property/Amenities\n\nRoadside trees, shrubs, any other plants, pole lines, fences, signs, monuments, buildings, pipelines, sewers and all highway facilities within or adjacent to the highway which are not to be disturbed shall be protected from injury or damage. The Contractor shall provide and install at his own cost, suitable safeguards approved by the Engineer for this purpose. During clearing and grubbing, the Contractor shall take all adequate precautions against soil erosion, water pollution, etc., and where required, undertake additional works to that effect vide Clause 306. Before start of operations, the Contractor shall submit to the Engineer for approval, his work plan including the procedure to be followed for disposal of waste materials, etc., and the schedules for carrying out temporary and permanent erosion control works as stipulated in Clause 306.3.\n\n# 201.3 Methods, Tools and Equipment\n\nOnly such methods, tools and equipment as are approved by the Engineer and which will not affect any property to be preserved shall be adopted for the Work. If the area has thick vegetation/roots/trees, a crawler or pneumatic tyred dozer of adequate capacity may be used for clearance purposes. The dozer shall have ripper attachments for removal of tree stumps. All trees, stumps, etc., falling within excavation and fill lines shall be cut to such depth below ground level that in no case these fall within 500 mm of the bottom of the subgrade. Also, all vegetation such as roots, under-growth, grass and other deleterious matter unsuitable for incorporation in the embankment/subgrade shall be removed between fill lines to the satisfaction of the Engineer. All branches of trees extending above the roadway shall be trimmed as directed by the Engineer.\n\nAll excavations below the general ground level arising out of the removal of trees, stumps, etc., shall be filled with suitable material and compacted thoroughly so as to make the surface at these points conform to the surrounding area.",

Any ruts or soft yielding places shall be corrected in an approved manner and rolled until firm surface is obtained.\n\nWhere the WBM is to be laid on an existing metalled road, damaged area including depressions and potholes shall be repaired and made good with the suitable material. The existing surface shall be scarified and re-shaped to the required grade and camber before spreading the coarse aggregate for WBM.\n\nAs far as possible, laying water bound macadam course over existing bituminous layer may be avoided since it will cause problems of internal drainage of the pavement at the interface of two courses. It is desirable to completely pick out the existing thin bituminous wearing course where water bound macadam is proposed to be laid over it.\n\n# 404.3.2 inverted choke/sub-surface drainage layer\n\nIf water bound macadam is to be laid directly over the sub-grade, without any other intervening pavement course, a 25 mm course of screenings (Grading B) or coarse sand shall be spread on the prepared sub-grade before application of the aggregates is taken up. In case of a fine sand or silty or clayey sub-grade, it is advisable to lay 100 mm insulating layer of screening or coarse sand on top of fine grained soil, the gradation of which will depend upon whether it is intended to act as a drainage layer as well. As a preferred alternative to inverted choke, appropriate geosynthetics performing functions of separation and drainage may be used over the prepared sub-grade as directed by the Engineer. Section 700 shall be applicable for use of geosynthetics.\n\n# 404.3.3 Lateral Confinement of Aggregates\n\nFor construction of WBM, arrangement shall be made for the lateral confinement of aggregates. This shall be done by building adjoining shoulders along with WBM layers. The practice of constructing WBM in a trench section excavated in the finished formation must be completely avoided.\n\nWhere the WBM course is to be constructed in narrow widths for widening of an existing pavement, the existing shoulders should be excavated to their full depth and width up to the sub-grade level except where widening specifications envisages laying of a stablised sub-base using in-situ operations in which case the same should be removed only up to the sub-base level.\n\n125",

In no case shall these be dumped in heaps directly on the area where these are to be laid nor shall their hauling over a partly completed base be permitted. Wherever possible, approved mechanical devices such as aggregate spreader shall be used to spread the aggregates uniformly so as to minimize the need for manual rectification afterwards.\n\nNo segregation of coarse aggregates shall be allowed and the coarse aggregates, as spread shall be of uniform gradation with no pockets of fine material.\n\nThe surface of the aggregates spread shall be carefully checked with templates and all high or low spots remedied by removing or adding aggregates as may be required. The surface shall be checked frequently with a straight edge while spreading and rolling so as to ensure a finished surface as per approved drawings.\n\nThe coarse aggregates shall not normally be spread more than 3 days in advance of the subsequent construction operations.\n\n# 404.3.5 Rolling\n\nImmediately following the spreading of the coarse aggregates, rolling shall be started with three wheeled power rollers of 80 to 100 kN capacity or tandem or vibratory rollers of 80 to 100 kN static weight.

The roller shall then move inward parallel to the center line of the road, in successive passes uniformly overlapping preceding tracks by at least one-half width.\n\nRolling shall be carried out on courses where coarse aggregates of crushed/broken stone are used, till the road metal is partially compacted. This will be followed by application of screenings and binding material where required in Clauses 404.3.6 and 404.3.7.\n\nHowever, where screenings are not to be applied as in the case of aggregates like brick metal, laterite and Kankar for sub-base construction, the compaction shall be continued until the aggregates are thoroughly keyed.

In no case shall the use of screenings be permitted to make up depressions.\n\nMaterial, which gets crushed excessively during compaction or becomes segregated, shall be removed and replaced with suitable aggregates.\n\n# 404.3.6 application of screenings\n\nAfter the coarse aggregates have been rolled to Clause 404.3.5, screenings to completely fill the interstices shall be applied gradually over the surface. These shall not be damp or wet at the time of application. Dry rolling shall be done while the screenings are being spread so that vibrations of the roller cause them to settle into the voids of the coarse aggregates. The screenings shall not be dumped in piles but be spread uniformly in successive thin layers either by the spreading motions of hand shovels or by mechanical spreaders, or directly from tipper with suitable grit spreading arrangement. Tipper operating for spreading the screenings shall be equipped with pneumatic tyres and operated so as not to disturb the coarse aggregates.\n\nThe screenings shall be applied at a slow and uniform rate (in three or more applications) so as to ensure filling of all voids. This shall be accompanied by dry rolling and brooming with mechanical brooms, hand brooms or both. In no case shall the screenings be applied so fast and thick as to form cakes or ridges on the surface in such a manner as would prevent filling of voids or prevent the direct bearing of the roller on the coarse aggregates. These operations shall continue until no more screenings can be forced into voids of the coarse aggregates.\n\nThe spreading, rolling, and brooming of screenings shall be carried out in only such lengths of the road which could be completed within one day\u2019s operation.\n\n# 404.3.7 sprinkling of water and grouting\n\nAfter application of screenings, the surface shall be copiously sprinkled with water, swept and rolled. Hand brooms shall be used to sweep the wet screenings into voids and to distribute them evenly. The sprinkling, sweeping and rolling operation shall be continued, with additional screenings applied as necessary until the coarse aggregates have been thoroughly keyed, well-bonded and firmly set in its full depth and a grout has been formed of screenings.

Optimum moisture and density shall be established by preparing cubes with varying moisture contents. Compaction of the mix shall be done in three layers with vibratory hammer fitted with a square or rectangular foot as described in Clause 903.5.1.1. After establishing the optimum moisture, a set of six cubes shall be cast at optimum moisture for the determination of compressive strength on the third and the seventh day. Trial mixes shall be repeated if the strength is not satisfactory by increasing cement content. After the mix design is approved, the Contractor shall construct a trial section in accordance with Clause 601.8.\n\nIf during the construction of the trial length, the optimum moisture content determined as above is found to be unsatisfactory, the Contractor may make suitable changes in the moisture content to achieve the satisfactory mix. The cube specimens prepared with the changed mix content should satisfy the strength requirement. Before production of the mix, natural moisture content of the aggregate should be determined on a day-to-day basis so that the moisture content could be adjusted. The mix finally designed should neither stick to the rollers nor become too dry resulting in ravelling of surface.\n\n# 601.8 Trial Length\n\n# 601.8.1\n\nThe trial length shall be constructed at least 14 days in advance of the proposed date of commencement of work. At least 30 days prior to the construction of the trial length, the Contractor shall submit for the Engineer\u2019s approval a \u201cMethod Statement\u201d giving detailed description of the proposed materials, plant, equipment, mix proportions, and procedure for batching, mixing, laying, compaction and other construction procedures. The Engineer shall also approve the location and length of trial construction which shall be a minimum of 100 m length laid in two days and for full width of the pavement. The trial length shall be outside the main works. The trial length shall contain the construction of at least one transverse construction joint involving hardened concrete and freshly laid Dry Lean Concrete sub-base. The construction of trial length shall be repeated till the Contractor proves his ability to satisfactorily construct the Dry Lean Concrete sub-base.\n\n# 601.8.2\n\nAfter the construction of the trial length, the in-situ density of the freshly laid material shall be determined by sand replacement method. Three density holes shall be made at locations equally spaced along a diagonal that bisects the trial length and average of these densities shall be determined. The density holes shall not be made in the strip 500 mm from the edges. The average density obtained from the three samples collected shall be the reference density and is considered as 100 percent. The field density of regular work will be compared with this reference density in accordance with Clauses 601.6.5.1 and 903.5.1.2.\n\n",

It includes geotextiles, geogrids, geostrips, geomembranes, geonets, geocomposites, geocells, geosynthetic mats, paving fabric and glass grid etc. Geo fabrics made from natural fibres such as jute, and coir referred to herein under natural geotextiles may also be used in different geotechnical engineering applications.\n\n# i) geotextiles\n\nAny permeable synthetic textile used with foundation, soil, rock, earth, or any other geotechnical engineering-related material as an integral part of a human-made project, structure, or system. The geotextile fabric shall be a woven, non-woven or knitted fabric consisting of long-chain polymeric filaments or yarns such as polypropylene, polyethylene or polyester or any combination thereof, formed into a stable network such that the filaments or yarns retain their relative position to each other.\n\nThere are several application areas for geotextiles requiring specific functions namely separation, filtration, drainage, reinforcement or a combination thereof.\n\n# ii) geogrids\n\nA deformed or non-deformed netlike polymeric material used with foundation, soil, rock, earth, or any other geotechnical engineering-related material as an integral part of human-made project, structure, or system. Geogrids have relatively high strength, high modulus, and low-creep-sensitive polymers with apertures varying from 10 to 100 mm in size or more. The openings/holes in geogrids are either elongated ellipse, near squares with rounded corners, squares or rectangles. Geogrids can be of uni-axial grid, bi-axial grid or three dimensional grids. Geostrip is another form of geogrid, which is used in reinforced soil structures. It is primarily made of synthetic material in strips and is made from high tenacity polyester yarn and contained in a suitable polymer sheath. These are used as reinforcement in pavements and reinforced soil slopes.\n\n# iii) geomembranes\n\nAn essentially impermeable membrane (liner or barrier) used with foundation, soil, rock, earth, or in any other geotechnical application as an integral part of human-made project, structure, or system, used to control fluid migration.\n\n299",

            "text": "# Section 700\n\n# Geosynthetics\n\nGeomembranes are made from PVC or polyethylene sheets, which are duly protected from ultraviolet exposure by carbon black or any antioxidants and thermal stabilizers. These are used as capillary cut off in roads in water logged areas.\n\n# iv) Geonets\n\nGeonets are used in combination with other types of geosynthetics. These are usually formed by continuous polymeric ribs at acute angle to one another. When the ribs are opened relatively large size apertures are formed in a net like configuration. These are used in combination with other geosynthetic materials to form a composite material.\n\n# v) Geocomposite\n\nA manufactured material, which could be a combination of any two or more synthetic materials like geotextiles, geogrids, geonets and geomembranes etc., in laminated or composite form. One of the popular form of geocomposite is Drainage Composite. Drainage Composites are formed by combining geotextile or geomembrane with a core of geonet or seratted/corrugated polymeric materials. Prefabricated Vertical Drains (PVD)/Band Drains and Fin Drains come under the category of geocomposites.\n\n# vi) Geocell\n\nIt is a three dimensional structure with interconnected cells. The geocells are made of polyester/polypropylene/high density polyethylene stabilized with carbon black. Geocells may be used in erosion control of slopes.\n\n# vii) Geosynthetic Mats\n\nThese are two dimensional or three dimensional mats with specified thickness, made of multi-filaments, with apertures to allow vegetation growth for erosion control application. Geosynthetic mat consists of UV stabilized non-degradable polypropylene/polyethylene or similar polymer fibres that are extruded or heat bonded to provide a dimensionally stable matrix. A tension element like steel wire mesh or geogrid shall be included in these mats as reinforcement, where these mats are required to posses more strength against erosive forces, like in steep slopes or in heavy rainfall areas. These are used for erosion protection of slopes.\n\n# viii) Natural Geotextiles\n\nThese geotextiles are made of natural fibres like jute or coir. The blankets/mats/mesh made of these fibres are sometimes further reinforced with polymeric nettings to enhance its tensile strength and for holding the fibres intact. The polymer netting is securely stitched on both sides of the fabric to form a strong quilted mat. These fabrics have excellent drapability and aid in quick growth of vegetation and are used for erosion control applications.",

They are heat bonded only on one side. Glass grids are either a composite glass fibre reinforced geogrid with continuous filament nonwoven geotextile chemically/mechanically bonded to the grid, or bituminous coated glass fibre geogrids with or without adhesive on one side of the grid. The paving fabric, glass grids and composite of fabric and glass grids are used in bituminous pavements to act as stress relieving membrane and crack retarding layer within the pavement structure.

Bitumen shall be sprayed at temperatures between 143\u00b0C and 163\u00b0C. For emulsions, the distributor tank temperatures shall be maintained between 55\u00b0C and 71\u00b0C. The target width of the tack coat application shall be equal to the Glass grid width plus 100-150 mm. The tack coat shall be applied only as far in advance of Glass grid installation as is appropriate to ensure a tacky surface at the time of Glass grid placement. Traffic shall not be allowed on the tack coat. Excess tack coat shall be cleaned from the pavement.\n\n# 708.3.4 paving fabric placement\n\nThe paving fabric shall be placed onto the tack coat using mechanical or manual lay down equipment capable of providing a smooth installation with a minimum amount of wrinkling or folding. The paving fabric shall be placed before to the tack coat cools and loses tackiness. After laying the paving fabric, some loose bituminous premix material shall be sprinkled on it in the wheel path of the paver and the tipper to ensure that the fabric is not picked up between the wheels. Paving fabric shall not be installed in areas where the bituminous overlay tapers to a thickness of less than 40 mm. Excess paving fabric which extends beyond the edge of existing pavement or areas of tack coat application shall be trimmed and removed.\n\nWhen bitumen emulsions are used, the emulsion shall be allowed to cure properly such that no water/moisture remains prior to placing the paving fabric. Wrinkles or folds in excess of 25 mm shall be single-lapped in the direction of the paving operation. Brooming and/or pneumatic rolling will be required to maximize paving fabric contact with the pavement surface. Additional hand-placed tack coat may be required at laps and repairs as determined by the Engineer to satisfy bitumen retention of the lapped paving fabric. All areas where paving fabrics have been placed shall be paved the same day. No traffic except necessary construction equipment will be allowed to drive on the paving fabric.

Damaged fabric shall be removed and replaced with the same type of fabric. Overlaps shall be shingle-lapped in the direction of paving. Additional tack coat shall be placed between the overlap to satisfy saturation requirements of the fabric. Overlap shall be sufficient to ensure full closure of the joint but not exceed 150 mm. Transverse joints shall be overlapped in the direction of the pavement by 100 to 150 mm or as per the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations or as directed by the Engineer. Longitudinal joints shall be overlapped by 20-30 mm or as per the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations or as directed by the engineer. The overlay operations shall be completed at the earliest after laying the fabric.\n\n# 708.3.5 Glass Grid Placement\n\nThe glass grid shall be placed on the surface provided by the tack coat using mechanical or manual lay down equipment capable of providing a smooth installation with a minimum amount of wrinkling or folding. On curves, the Glass grid must be cut and realigned to match the curvature.\n\nGlass grid shall not be installed in areas where the bituminous overlay tapers to a compacted thickness of less than 40 mm. When emulsions are used, the emulsion shall be allowed to cure properly such that no water/moisture remains prior to placing the glass grid. Wrinkles severe enough to cause folds shall be slit and laid flat. Brooming and/or rubber-tire rolling will be required to maximize glass grid contact with the pavement surface. Additional hand-placed tack coat may be required at overlaps and repairs as required by the Engineer. Turning and braking of the paver and other vehicles shall be done gradually and kept to a minimum to avoid movement and damage to the glass grid. Damaged composite shall be removed and replaced with the same type of composite and a tack coat.\n\nAll areas where glass grid has been placed shall be paved the same day. No traffic except necessary construction traffic shall be allowed to drive on the glass grid. Overlaps shall be shingle-lapped in the direction of paving. Additional tack coat shall be placed between the overlap to satisfy saturation requirements of the fabric. Overlap shall be sufficient to ensure full closure of the joint but not exceeding 150 mm.\n\n# 708.3.6 Overlay Placement\n\nBituminous overlay construction shall closely follow the placement of paving fabric or glass-grid. Excess tack coat that bleeds through the paving fabric or glass grid shall be removed by broadcasting hot mix or sand on the glass grid. Excess sand or hot mix shall be removed before beginning the paving operation. In the event of rainfall prior to the placement of the asphalt overlay, the fabric must be allowed to dry completely before the overlay is placed. Overlay asphalt thickness shall meet the requirements of the contract drawings and documents. The minimum compacted thickness of the first lift of overlay asphalt concrete shall not be less than 40 mm.\n\n321\n\n",

They may be used singly or in groups to mark a specific condition, or they may be used in a series for channelizing traffic. Type I barricades normally would be used on conventional roads or urban streets and arterials. Type II barricades have more retro-reflective area and are intended for use on highways and expressways or other high-speed roadways.\n\n# 813.6.3.2\n\nType III barricades be used for road closure and may extend completely across a roadway or from kerb to kerb. Where provision is made for access of authorized equipment and vehicles, the responsibility should be assigned to a person to ensure proper closure at the end of each work day. When a highway is legally closed but access must still be allowed for local traffic, the Type III barricade should not be extended completely across a roadway. A sign with the appropriate legend concerning permissible use by local traffic shall be mounted.\n\nSigns may be erected on barricades, particularly those of the fixed type, that offer a most advantageous facility for this purpose. The ROAD CLOSED and DETOUR or ARROW signs, and the large arrow warning signs, for example, can be mounted effectively on or above the barricade that closes the roadway.",

However, where the surface is low, the same shall be corrected as described herein below.\n\nFor cement treated material, when the time elapsed between detection of irregularity and the time of mixing of the material is less than 2 hours, the surface shall be scarified to a depth of 50 mm, supplemented with freshly mixed materials as necessary and recompacted as per the relevant specification. When this time is more than 2 hours, the full depth of the layer shall be removed from the pavement and replaced with fresh material to Specification. This shall also apply to lime treated material except that the time criterion shall be 3 hours instead of 2 hours.\n3. # Water Bound Macadam/wet Mix Macadam sub-base/Base:\n\nWhere the surface is high or low, the top 75 mm shall be scarified, reshaped with added material as necessary and recompacted as per Clause 404 in the case of Water Bound Macadam and to Clause 406 in the case of Wet Mix Macadam.\n4. # Bituminous constructions:\n\nFor bituminous construction other than wearing course, where the surface is low, the deficiency shall be corrected by adding fresh material over a suitable tack coat, if needed, and recompacting as per specifications. Where the surface is high, the extra thickness in the affected layer shall be removed and replaced with fresh material and compacted to Specifications.\n\nFor wearing course, where the surface is high or low, the full depth of the layer shall be removed and replaced with fresh material and compacted to specifications. In all cases where the removal and replacement of a bituminous layer is involved, the area treated shall not be less than 5 m in length and not less than 3.5 m in width.\n5. # Dry lean concrete sub-Base:\n\nThe defective length of the course shall be removed to full depth and replaced with material conforming to clause 601. The area treated shall be at least 3 m long, not less than 1 lane width and extend to the full depth. Before relaying the course, the disturbed subgrade or layer below shall be corrected by levelling, watering and compacting.",

If high areas in excess 6 mm or low areas in excess of 3 mm occur, exceeding the permitted numbers and if the Contractor cannot rectify, the slab shall be demolished and reconstructed at the Contractor\u2019s expense and in no case the area removed shall be less than the full width of the lane in which the irregularity occurs and full length of the slab.\n\nIf deemed necessary by the Engineer, any section of the slab which deviates from the specified levels and tolerances shall be demolished and reconstructed at the Contractor\u2019s cost.\n\n# 902.6 Riding Quality\n\nThe riding quality of bituminous concrete wearing surface, as measured by a standard towed fifth wheel bump integrator, shall not be more than 2000 mm per Km.\n\n# 903 Quality control tests during construction\n\n# 903.1 General\n\nThe materials supplied and the works carried out by the Contractor shall conform to the specifications prescribed in the Clauses for the relevant items of work.\n\nFor ensuring the requisite quality of construction, the materials and works shall be subjected to quality control tests, as described hereinafter. The testing frequencies set forth are the desirable minimum and the Engineer shall have the full authority to carry out additional tests as frequently as he may deem necessary, to satisfy himself that the materials and works comply with the appropriate specifications. However, the number of tests recommended in Tables 900-3 and 900-4 may be reduced at the discretion of the Engineer if it is felt that consistency in the quality of materials can still be maintained with the reduced number of tests.\n\nTest procedures for the various quality control tests are indicated in the respective Sections of these Specifications or for certain tests within this Section.

The specimens shall be transported in an approved manner to prevent sudden impact causing fractures or damage to the specimen. The flexural strength test results shall prevail over compressive strength tests for compliance.\n\n# 903.5.2.2\n\nA quality control chart indicating the strength values of individual specimens shall be maintained for continuous quality assurance. Where the requirements are not met with, or where the quality of the concrete or its compaction is suspect, the actual strength of the concrete in the slab shall be ascertained by carrying out tests on cores cut at the rate of 2 cores for every 150 cu.m of concrete. The average of the results of crushing strength tests on these cores shall not be less than 0.8 x 0.85 times the corresponding characteristic compressive strength of cubes, where the height to diameter ratio of the cores is two. Where height to diameter ratio is not two, necessary corrections shall be made in calculating the crushing strength of cubes in the following manner.\n\nThe crushing strengths of cylinders with height to diameter ratios between 1 and 2 may be corrected to correspond to a standard cylinder of height to diameter ratio of 2 by multiplying with the correction factor obtained from the following equation:\n\nf = 0.11 n + 0.78\n\nwhere f = correction factor and n = height to diameter ratio\n\nThe corrected test results shall be analysed for conformity with the specification requirements for cube samples. Where the core tests are satisfactory, they shall have precedence for assessing concrete quality over the results of moulded specimens. The diameter of cores shall not be less than 150 mm.\n\nIf, however, the tests on cores also confirm that the concrete is not satisfying the strength requirements, then the concrete corresponding to the area from which the cores were cut should be replaced, i.e., at least over an area extending between two transverse joints where the defects could be isolated or over larger area, if necessary, as assessed by additional cores and their test results. The equivalent flexural strength at 28 days shall be estimated in accordance with Clause 602.3.3.2.\n\nIn order to ensure that the specified minimum strength at 28 days is attained in 1 in 20 of all test beams, the mix shall be proportioned to give an average strength at 28 days exceeding the specified strength by 1.65 times the standard deviation calculated first from the flexural strengths of test beams made from the trial mix and subsequently from the accumulating result of flexural strengths of job control test beams.\n\n431",

At the start of the work, and until such time as the Engineer may order a reduction in the number of beams required, at least six pairs of beams and cubes shall be made each day, one of each pair for testing at 28 days for determination of minimum permissible flexural strength and the other for testing at an early age for the Engineer to assess the quality of the mix. When the first thirty number of 28-day results are available, and for so long as the Engineer is satisfied with the quality of the mix, he may reduce the number of beams and cubes required.\n\nDuring the course of construction, when the source of any material is to be changed, or if there is any variation in the quality of the materials furnished, additional tests and necessary adjustments in the mix shall be made as required to obtain the specified strength.\n\nThe flexural strengths obtained on beams tested before 28 days shall be used in conjunction with a correlation between them and the 28 day flexural strengths to detect any deterioration in the quality of the concrete being produced. Any such deterioration shall be remedied without awaiting the 28 day strengths but the earlier strengths shall not constitute sole evidence of non-compliance of the concrete from which they were taken.\n\nConcrete shall be deemed not to comply with the Specification when more than one test beam in a batch has a 28 day strength less than the specified strength and the average 28 day flexural strength of the batch of beams is less than the specified strength plus 1.65 times the standard deviation of the batch.\n\nShould the concrete fail to comply with the Specification for strength as described above, the Contractor may, all at his own expense, elect to cut cores from the suspect concrete as the Engineer shall direct. From the relation between cube strength and flexural strength, the core strength shall be converted to flexural strength.\n\nThe equivalent flexural strength at 28 days shall be the estimated in-situ strength multiplied by 100 and divided by the age-strength relation obtained from Table 900-5.\n\nAny concrete that fails to meet the strength specification shall be removed and replaced at Contractor\u2019s expense.\n\n432",

The air voids shall be derived from the difference between the theoretical maximum dry density of the concrete calculated from the specific gravity of the constituents of the concrete mix and the average value of three direct density measurements made on cores at least 150 mm diameter. Three cores shall be taken from trial lengths and in first two km length of the pavement, while the slab is being constructed during normal working. The proportions of the mix and the vibratory effort imparted i.e. the frequency and magnitude of vibration shall be adjusted to achieve the maximum density.\n\nAll cores taken for density measurement in the trial section shall also be checked for thickness. The same cores shall be made use of for determining in-situ strength. In case of doubt, additional cores may be ordered by the Engineer and taken at locations decided by him to check the density of concrete slab or the position of dowel/tie bars without any compensation being paid for the same.\n\nIn calculation of the density, allowance shall be made for any steel in cores. Cores removed from the main carriageway shall be reinstated with compacted concrete with mix proportions of 1 part of Portland cement : 2 parts of fine aggregate:2 parts of 10 mm nominal size single sized coarse aggregate by weight. Before filling the fine mix, the sides shall be hacked and cleaned with water. Thereafter cement-sand slurry shall be applied to the sides just prior to filling the concrete mix.\n\n# 903.5.2.4 thickness\n\nThickness shall be controlled by taking levels as indicated in Clause 902.3. Thickness of the slab at any point checked as mentioned above shall be within a tolerance of -5 mm to + 10 mm of the specified thickness as per Drawing. Thickness deficiency more than 5 mm may be accepted and paid for at a reduced rate given in Clause 602.16.3. In no case, however, thickness deficiency shall be more than 10 mm.\n\n434",

The force of the hammer shall be directed centrally and axially during driving. Forces producing undue bending or torsional stresses in piles shall not be applied during driving.\n\nThe stroke of a single acting or drop hammer shall be limited to 1.2 m unless otherwise permitted by the Engineer.

(delays of an hour or less may lead to significant \u201cset-up\u201d in piles i.e. resistance to further driving increases after driving is stopped).\n\nIf any pile is damaged in any way during driving, it shall be repaired or replaced as directed by the Engineer, at the cost of the Contractor. If during driving, the head of a pile is damaged to the extent that further driving is not possible, the head shall be cut off and driving continued. The cost of cutting off shall be borne by the Contractor and where, as a result of such cutting off the head, the pile is too short, the Contractor, shall, at his own cost, supply and splice on sufficient length of pile to restore the pile to its correct length.\n\nPiles should be driven to the minimum acceptable penetration shown on the drawings. This may require pre-boring and/or jetting as indicated in Clause 111.2, with the approval of the Engineer.\n\nPiles shall be driven to nominal refusal or the required ultimate dynamic capacity mentioned on the drawings or until the top of the pile is at the level required and specified on the drawing whichever gives the lowest toe elevation.

For floating caissons, a detailed method statement covering fabrication, floating and sinking operations, shall be prepared and furnished to the Engineer. Such statement shall include the total tonnage of steel involved, fabrication and welding specifications, list of materials and plant and a description of operations and manpower required for the work.\n\n# 1206.2\n\nFloating caissons shall be of structural steel conforming to Section 1900 of these Specifications. The joints of the fabricated structure shall be absolutely leak-tight and shall be checked against leakage before floating and being towed to site. The reinforcement of the curb and steining of the well shall be fixed inside the shell by welding before the caisson is floated. Stability of floating caissons shall be ensured against overturning and capsizing under the action of water current, wave pressure and wind while being towed and kept in position. To maintain the stability of the shell while being floated, it may be provided with ballast in the form of water filling up to required level or filling with small amount of concrete. It shall be ensured that the draught of the floating caisson is always less than the depth of water available, so as to facilitate its smooth hindrance-free movement while being towed.\n\n# 1206.3\n\nHeight of caisson shall be planned to ensure that at any given time, at least one metre of the shell shall be above water level. In case the location is affected by the action of waves, the height shall be suitably increased to avoid water spilling into the caisson. In case the bed has soft soil, the caisson shall be provided with 3 to 5 metres of additional height, as it may sink by itself after grounding in bed. Simultaneous sinking and concreting is required to prevent caisson from tilting. In sandy stratum especially with strong water current, appropriate additional height of caisson is necessary for accommodating local scour.\n\n# 1206.4\n\nThe floating caisson shall be held in position against untoward movement by wire ropes/chains, using winches mounted on stationary suitable platforms/buoys or similar anchoring systems. Anchoring in minimum three directions, shall be provided to prevent unacceptable longitudinal and lateral movement. The anchoring system shall permit small movements in order to facilitate correct positioning of the caisson at the exact location of the well and until the stage when it is just getting grounded. Special care is necessary where variation in water level is frequent, e.g. in tidal zones.\n\n# 1206.5\n\nAfter being held in correct position, concreting of the floating caisson shall be commenced. The concrete mixed in batching plants, shall be carried to the floating caisson on barges and placed in position through concrete pumps or tremie. When large volumes of concreting are involved, the batching plant concrete pump, crane etc, may all be mounted on a barge kept in the vicinity of the caisson. As no vibration is possible inside the shell, it shall be ensured that the concrete has a slump of 150 to 200; alternatively, self-compacting concrete can be used. The concrete shall be carefully placed uniformly all around the caisson so that it settles vertically without any tendency to tilt.\n\n482",

In case timber forms are used, they shall be lined with plywood or M.S. sheets.\n\n1207.2 The height of the first lift of steining to be cast above the well curb shall not be more than 2 m and subsequent lifts shall not exceed the diameter of the well or the depth of well to be sunk below the bed level at any time. For stability, the first lift of steining shall be cast only after sinking the curb at least partially. Concreting of steining may be carried out in subsequent lifts of about 2 to 2.5 m. Attempts should be made to minimize the number of construction joints. The concreting layers shall be limited to 450 mm restricting the free fall of concrete to not more than 1.5 m. Laitance formed at the top surface of a lift shall be removed to expose coarse aggregates before setting of concrete at the proposed construction joint. As far as possible, construction joints shall not be kept at the location of laps in the vertical steining bars.\n\n1207.3 The steining of the well shall be built in one straight line from bottom to top such that if the well is titled, the next lift of steining will be aligned in the direction of the tilt.

After sinking of a stage is complete, damaged portions if any, of steining at top of the previous stage shall be properly repaired before constructing the next stage.\n\n1207.4 For measuring the height of steining, it shall be marked with at least 4 gauges, two in traffic direction and two normal to traffic direction, distributed equally on the outer face of the well. The marking shall be in the form of a 100 mm wide strip painted on the steining, with every metre marked in black paint. Marking of the gauges shall be done carefully and accurately with a steel tape, starting with zero at the bottom of the cutting edge.

Use of water jetting, explosives and divers may be adopted for sinking of wells through difficult strata, with prior approval of the Engineer. Well sinking can also be carried out by jack down method.\n\nNormally dewatering of well should not be permitted as a means for sinking the well. It shall never be resorted to if there is any danger of sand blowing under the well. Dewatering shall however be done when well is to be founded in rock. Pneumatic sinking may have to be resorted to where obstacles such as tree trunks, large sized boulders etc. are met or when there is hard strata which cannot be removed by open dredging. The necessity for adopting pneumatic sinking shall be decided by the Engineer.\n\nComplete history of sinking of each well giving details of concreting, sinking and problems met, if any, shall be maintained in the format given in Appendix 1200/I.\n\n# 1208.2 Sand Blows in Wells\n\nDewatering of the well shall not be carried out if sand blows are expected. Any equipment or men working inside the well, shall be brought outside the well as soon as there are any indications of sand blow occurring. Sand blow can often be minimized by keeping the level of water inside the well higher than the water table and also by adding heavy kentledge.\n\n# 1208.3 Use of Kentledge for Sinking of Well\n\nKentledge shall be placed in an orderly and safe manner on the loading platform and in such a way that it does not interfere with the excavation of the material from inside the dredge hole and also does not in any way damage the steining of the well.\n\nWhere tilt has occurred or there is a danger of well developing a tilt, the position of the load shall be regulated in such a manner as to provide greater sinking effort on the higher side of the well.\n\n# 1208.4 Use of Water Jetting\n\nWater jetting can be used to facilitate sinking of wells through clay/hard strata. The decision regarding use of water jetting shall be taken at the design stage itself, based on geotechnical investigations which may be indicating presence of hard, clayey strata. For carrying out water jetting, the required number of steel pipes of 40 to 50 mm diameter shall be embedded in the steining of the well, spaced evenly around its periphery.

The steel pipe shall be kept about 1m above the top of each lift of steining, so that it can be extended by means of suitable couplers before the next lift of steining is cast. When the well reaches the hard strata and the need for water jetting arises, the tops of the embedded pipes shall be connected to pumps of required capacity for pumping in water at high pressure. The water jet issuing from the nozzle of the pipe under high pressure, cuts through the hard material and loosens it, permitting the well to sink at a faster rate than would otherwise have been possible. When water jetting is to be adopted, the Contractor shall furnish a method statement for approval of the Engineer covering all aspects of the work including the number, capacity and location of the high pressure pumps and other ancillaries required for executing the work.\n\n# 1208.5 use of Jack down Method\n\nThe jack down method of sinking shall be adopted as per requirement or as directed by the Engineer. The first step shall be to install ground anchors outside the periphery of the well. The number, location and depth of ground anchors are decided based on the properties of the surrounding soil to develop the necessary resisting force through skin friction. The drill holes of about 150 mm diameter along with casings shall be taken down to a depth of about 20 m or more below the founding level of the well, depending on requirements of design. After the holes have been drilled to the required depth, prestressing strands of adequate diameter and capacity are cut to the desired length and lowered into the holes. The holes shall then be grouted with cement slurry with non-shrink additive. Once the grouting is completed till the ground level, the casing is removed. The removal of the casing shall be done before the grout sets. In case rock is met with, the anchors shall be socketed into rock.\n\nHeavy duty pressurization girders fabricated of steel, shall be placed over stools resting on the steining of the well, against which the hydraulic jacks connected to the ground anchors, can exert pressure to push the well down. The hydraulic jacks shall be of capacity 500 T or more as per requirement. Before applying pressure from the jacks, 1 m deep sump is created inside the well by dredging. Pressure on different jacks is exerted in such a manner as to neutralize any tendency of the well to tilt. With the use of the jacks and controlled dredging, high rates of sinking can be achieved and the chances of sand blowing can also be reduced.\n\nFor use of jack down method of sinking, the Contractor shall furnish a method statement for approval of the Engineer, giving full details of construction of ground anchors, fabrication of pressurizing girder, type, number and capacity of jacks to be used, method of dredging and application of jack down force and all other relevant aspects for proper execution of the work.\n\n# 1208.6 use of explosives\n\nMild explosive charges may be used as an aid for sinking of the well.

Cement shall be proportioned by weight, taking the unit weight of cement as 1.44 tonne per cubic metre. Sand shall be proportioned by volume with due allowance for bulking. All mortar shall be mixed with a minimum quantity of water to produce desired workability consistent with required density. The mix shall be clean and free from soil, acid, alkali, organic matter or other deleterious substances.\n\nThe mixing shall be done in a mechanical mixer operated manually or by power. As an exception, hand mixing can also be resorted to as long as uniform density of the mix and its strength are assured. Hand mixing shall be permitted only for very small and isolated works like CD works, subject to the prior approval of the Engineer. Hand mixing shall be carried out on a clean watertight platform, where cement and sand shall be first mixed dry in the required proportion by being turned over and over, backwards and forwards, several times till the mixture is of uniform colour. Thereafter, minimum quantity of water shall be added to bring the mortar to the consistency of a stiff paste. The mortar shall be mixed for at least two minutes after addition of water.\n\nMortar shall be mixed only in such quantity as required for immediate use. The mix which has developed initial set shall not be used. Initial set of mortar with ordinary Portland Cement shall normally be considered to have taken place in 30 minutes after mixing. In case the mortar has stiffened during initial setting time because of evaporation of water, it can be re-tempered by adding water as frequently as needed to restore the requisite consistency, but such re-tempering shall not be permitted 30 minutes after mixing. Mortar remaining unused for more than 30 minutes after mixing, shall be rejected and removed from site of work.\n\n501",

The delivery end of the chute shall be as close as possible to the point of deposit. The chute shall be thoroughly flushed with water before and after each working period and the water used for this purpose shall be discharged outside the formwork.\n\nIn case concrete is to be transported by pumping, the fresh concrete should have adequate fluidity and cohesiveness to be pumpable. Proper concrete mix proportioning and initial trials should ensure this. The conduit shall be primed by pumping a batch of mortar through the line to lubricate it. Once the pumping is started, it shall not be interrupted, as concrete standing idle in the line is liable to cause plug. The operator shall ensure that some concrete is always there in the pump\u2019s receiving hopper during operation. The lines shall always be maintained clean and free of dents.\n\nPipelines from the pump to the placing area shall be laid with minimum bends. For large quantity placements, standby pumps shall be available. Suitable air release valves, shutoff valves etc. shall be provided as per site requirements. The pumping of priming mix i.e. rich mix of creamy consistency, to lubricate the concrete pump and pipelines, shall precede the pumping of concrete. Continuous pumping shall be done to the extent possible. After concreting, the pipelines and accessories shall be cleaned immediately. The pipes for pumping shall not be made of material which has adverse effect on concrete. Aluminium alloy pipelines shall not be used.\n\n# 1708.5 Placing of Concrete\n\nAll formwork and reinforcement contained in it shall be cleaned and made free from standing water, dust, snow or ice immediately before placing of concrete.\n\nNo concrete shall be placed in any part of the structure until the approval of the Engineer has been obtained. If concreting is not started within 24 hours of the approval being given, the approval shall have to be obtained again from the Engineer. Concreting shall proceed continuously over the area between the construction joints. Fresh concrete shall not be placed against concrete which has been in position for more than 30 minutes, unless a proper construction joint is formed.\n\nThe concrete shall be deposited as nearly as practicable in its original position to avoid re-handling. Methods of placing should be such as to preclude segregation. Care should be taken to avoid displacement of reinforcement or movement of formwork. To achieve this, concrete should be lowered vertically in the form and horizontal movement of concrete inside the forms should, as far as practicable, be minimised.\n\n548",

The workability of concrete at the time of placement shall be adequate for the compaction equipment to be used. If there is considerable time gap between mixing and placing of concrete, as in the case of ready mixed concrete plants or off-site batching and mixing plants, concrete mix shall be designed to have appropriately higher workability at the time of discharge from the mixer, in order to compensate the loss of workability during transit. This is generally achieved by suitable chemical admixtures. Keeping these considerations in view, the general requirement for ready mixed concrete plants or off-site batching and mixing plants, is that concrete shall be discharged from the truck mixer within two hours of the time of loading. A longer period may be permitted if suitable retarding admixtures are used.\n\nIn wall forms, drop chutes attached to hoppers at the top should preferably be used to lower concrete to the bottom of the form. As a general guidance, the permissible free fall of concrete may not exceed 1.5 metres and under no circumstances shall it be more than 2 metres. When free fall of larger height is involved, self compacting concrete having adequate fluidity, cohesiveness and viscosity and which uniformly and completely fills every corner of the formwork by its own weight without segregation, shall be used.\n\nExcept where otherwise agreed to by the Engineer, concrete shall be deposited in horizontal layers to a compacted depth of not more than 450 mm when internal vibrators are used and not more than 300 mm in all other cases.\n\nConcrete when deposited shall have temperature of not less than 5\u00baC and preferably not more than 30\u00baC and in no case more than 40\u00baC. In case of site mixing, fresh concrete shall be placed and compacted in its final position within 30 minutes of its discharge from the mixer. When the concrete is carried in properly designed agitator operating continuously, the concrete shall be placed and compacted within 1 hour of the addition of cement to the mix and within 30 minutes of its discharge from the agitator. It may be necessary to add retarding admixtures to concrete, if trials show that the periods indicated above are unacceptable. In all such matters, the Engineer\u2019s decision shall be final.\n\n# 1708.6 Compaction of Concrete\n\nConcrete shall be thoroughly compacted by vibration or other means during placing and worked around the reinforcement, tendons or duct formers, embedded fixtures and into corners of the formwork to produce a dense homogeneous void-free mass having the required surface finish. When vibrators are used, vibration shall be done continuously during the placing of each batch of concrete until the expulsion of air has practically ceased and in a manner that does not promote segregation.

Additional vibrators in serviceable condition shall be kept at site so that they can be used in the event of breakdown.\n\nMechanical vibrators used shall comply with IS:2502, IS:2506, IS:2514 and IS:4656.\n\n# 1709 Construction Joints\n\nConstruction joints shall be avoided as far as possible. In no case shall the locations of such joints be changed or increased from those shown on the drawings except with the express approval of the Engineer.\n\nJoints should be positioned where they are readily accessible for preparation and concreting. Construction joints should be positioned to minimize the effects of the discontinuity of the durability, structural integrity and appearance of the structure. As far as possible, joints should be provided in non-aggressive zones, but if joints in aggressive zones cannot be avoided, they should be sealed. Joints should be located away from the regions of maximum stress caused by loading; particularly where shear and bond stresses are high.\n\nIn beams and slabs joints should not be near the supports. Construction joints between slabs and ribs in composite beams, shall be avoided. For box girders, there shall be no construction joint between the soffit and webs.\n\nJoints should be either vertical or horizontal.

To minimise the formation of laitance, care shall be exercised not to disturb the concrete as far as possible while it is being deposited.\n\nAll under water concreting shall be carried out by tremie method only. The number and spacing of the tremies should be worked out to ensure proper concreting. However, it is necessary to have a minimum number of 2 tremies for any concreting operation, so that even if one of the tremies goes out of commission during concreting, the other one can be used to complete the work. The tremie concreting when started, should continue without interruption for the full height of the member being concreted.

It will be necessary to raise the tremie slowly in order to allow a uniform flow of concrete. At all times after placing of concrete is started and until all the required quantity has been placed, the lower end of the tremie pipe shall be kept below the surface of the plastic concrete and shall not be taken out of concrete.

This shall be achieved by using chilled mixing water, using crushed ice as a part of mixing water, shading stock piles of aggregates from direct rays of the sun, sprinkling the stock piles of coarse aggregate with water to keep them moist, limiting temperature of cement below 30\u00baC at the time of use, starting curing before concrete dries out and restricting time of concreting as far as possible to early mornings and late evenings. When ice is used to cool mixing water, it will be considered as part of the water in design mix.

The optimum sequence of mixing of ingredients shall be established by trials. Mixing time may be longer than in normal grade concrete mixes. The temperature of concrete at the time of placement shall not exceed 25\u00b0C. The temperature of concrete at the mixing stage should be lower, to allow for rise in temperature during transport. When considerable distance of transport is involved, particular attention should be paid to ensure retention of slump as targeted for placement.\n\n# 1715.7 Prototype testing\n\nMock-up trials or prototype testing may be carried out to ensure that the concrete can be satisfactorily placed and compacted, taking into account the location of placement and provision of reinforcement, and required adjustments made in concrete mix design and/or detailing of reinforcement.\n\n# 1715.8 Curing of Concrete\n\nHigh performance concrete containing silica fume is more cohesive than normal mixes hence, there is a little or no bleeding and no bleed water to rise to the surface to offset water loss due to evaporation. Plastic shrinkage cracking is possible, if curing is not proper. Initial curing should commence soon after initial setting of concrete. Concrete should be covered with moist covers, opaque colour plastic sheets or suitable curing compound. Final moist curing should commence after final setting of concrete and continue for at least 14 days.\n\n# 1715.9 additional tests for Concrete\n\nApart from the strength tests prescribed in other Sections of these Specifications, the additional tests as specified under Clause 1714.3, shall also be carried out.\n\n# 1716 toleRanCes\n\nTolerances for dimensions/shape of various components shall be as indicated in these Specifications or shown on the drawings or as directed by the Engineer.\n\n# 1717 tests and standaRds oF aCCePtanCe\n\n# 1717.1\n\nConcrete shall conform to the surface finish and tolerance as prescribed in these Specifications for respective components.\n\n558",

When such phased supply is made, each such lot shall be considered as a large lot for the purpose of acceptance testing.\n\n# 2005.4.2 levels of acceptance testing\n\nThe following two Levels of acceptance testing shall be adopted, depending on lot size:\n\nAcceptance testing Level 1 is a higher level of inspection and testing and shall be applicable to large lots only, unless otherwise specified. This shall involve manufacture of two extra bearings for each lot to be used as test bearings and eventually consumed in destructive testing.\n\nAcceptance testing Level 2 shall be applicable to small lots only, for which one extra bearing shall be manufactured and shall not involve destructive testing of finished bearing. Out of the lot, one bearing shall be selected at random for carrying out material tests. This bearing shall be excluded from the lot accepted.\n\nAcceptance testing Level 1 may be specified for small lots also at the sole discretion of the Engineer taking into account the special importance of a bridge project. The cost of extra bearings, in such cases shall be borne by the user, while the cost of all other materials, equipment and testing shall be borne by manufacturer.\n\n# 2005.4.3 testing\n\nAcceptance testing shall comprise general inspection, test on specially moulded test pieces and test on complete bearings or sections for measurement of various quality characteristics detailed below:\n\n# 2005.4.3.1 acceptance testing level 1\n\nGeneral inspection\n\n1. All bearings of the lot shall be visually inspected for absence of any defects in surface finish, shape, hardness or any other discernible superficial defects.\n2. All bearings of the lot shall be checked for tolerances for overall dimensions, mean bearing thickness, parallelism of bearing surfaces and flatness of load bearing surfaces as specified in Table 2000-3.\n\n640",

The temperature of the room in which the bearings are tested shall not vary more than 10 \u00baC. The main objective of this test is to eliminate poorly made bearings by visual inspection in a quick and efficient way. All bearings of the lot shall be subjected to an axial load to correspond to the design load at serviceability limit state while visual examination is made to check for discernible defects like:\n\n- Misalignment of reinforcing plates\n- Poor bond at laminate/steel interface\n- Variation in elastomer layer thickness\n- Any surface defects developed during testing\n\niv) During acceptance testing, complete test data shall be furnished by the manufacturer and one bearing per lot shall be selected at random and the same test shall be repeated. The bearings shall then be visually inspected for defects and the stiffness shall also be measured.\n\nv) During the test, the deflection between 30 percent and 100 percent of the maximum load for the application shall be recorded and used to check the consistency of the stiffness value. Variation in stiffness of any individual bearing from the mean of the measured values for all such bearings of the lot, shall not be larger than 20 percent of the mean value.\n\nvi) In case of any visual defect or unacceptable stiffness during acceptance testing, all bearings of the lot shall be subjected to the same test again and only the bearing that passes the test in all respects, shall be accepted.\n\n# Tests on Specially Moulded Test Pieces\n\ni) Test pieces shall be moulded by the manufacturer with identical compound and under identical vulcanising conditions as used in the manufacture of the bearings of the acceptance lot.

For a mix of 5 kg batch, a mixing rotor attached to 350 W, 400 rpm electric hand drilling machine may be used. The speed of revolution should not exceed 400 rpm in order to avoid entrapment of air and excessive frictional heat leading to shorter pot life. The mixing time should not exceed 3 minutes. For fast reacting and medium fast reacting formulations, the temperature should not be allowed to rise above 40\u00baC while for slow reacting formulations, it should not rise above 60\u00baC. The mixing paddles should scrape the bottom and sides of the container so as to ensure complete mixing of the two components. The mixing should be carried out as close as possible to the site where the epoxy is to be used, so as to avoid loss of time and wastage of pot life in transport.\n\nEpoxy shall be tested for its conformance to the FIP-1978 \u201cProposal for Standard Tests and Verification of Epoxy Bonding Agents for Segmental Construction\u201d.

In the former case, post tensioning is imparted to the girder section alone whereas in the latter case, the post tensioning is imparted to the composite section.\n\nA preferred location of splice will be the points of minimum stress such as one-third span points.

The subsurface investigation shall be carried out in such a way that the profiles of different types of soil for the entire length of the proposed structure are obtained and recorded. Other information to be obtained are mechanical and physical properties such as grain-size distribution, sensitivity, existence of deleterious material in soil or ground water, porosity of rock, subsidence due to mining, ground water level, artesian condition, likely sinking and driving effort and likely constructional difficulties.\n\n# 2401.2\n\nThe field work shall consist of excavation, drilling of boreholes for the purpose of collection of undisturbed and disturbed samples, standard penetration tests, in-situ vane tests, static and dynamic cone penetration tests, other field tests, as specified by the Engineer and preparation of bore logs. It will also include collection, preservation and testing of disturbed and undisturbed samples from boreholes, borrow pits, etc. as specified by the Engineer. All in-situ tests shall be supplemented by laboratory investigations. Relevant Indian Standards such as IS:1498, IS:1888, IS:1892, IS:2131, IS:2132, IS:2720, IS:4434 and IS:4968 and Annex 2 of IRC:78 shall be followed for guidance.\n\n# 2401.3\n\nThe soundings by dynamic method, where required shall be carried out in bore holes using a standard sampler as specified in IS:2131.\n\n# 2402 Extent and Number of Bores\n\n# 2402.1\n\nInvestigations shall cover the entire length of the bridge and also extend on either side for a distance about twice the depth below bed of the last main foundation. Bores shall be taken at the location of each pier and abutment of the bridge. A minimum of two bores shall be taken in the approaches on either side, along the centre line of the alignment, at a distance of 50 m and 120 m behind the abutment positions. In case of viaducts in the approaches on either side of the bridge, bores shall be taken at the location of each foundation of the viaduct spans.\n\n# 2402.2\n\nWhere detailed investigation indicates appreciable variation or where variations in a particular foundation are likely to appreciably affect the construction (specially in case of bridge foundations resting on rock), it will be necessary to take additional bores in the transverse direction also, to establish complete profile of the underlying strata. The number of additional bores shall be decided depending upon the extent of variation in local geology at a particular foundation location and should cover the entire area of that foundation.\n\n687",

In clayey deposits, such samples could be collected by split spoon samplers. In sandy deposits, sampling spoons shall be fitted with suitable devices for retaining samples. All data required for soil identification (Appendix-2.1 of IRC:75) should be collected from the samples so extracted when undisturbed samples are not available. Penetration test should be carried out with the standard split spoon sampler or penetrometers if the soil is coarse grained. If the soil profile is known to be fairly regular, preliminary and detailed investigation may be combined. Tube samplers can be used in place of split spoon samplers for collecting samples in clayey strata.\n\n# 2409.2 disturbed soil samples\n\n# 2409.2.1\n\nDisturbed samples of soil shall be obtained in the course of excavation and boring. For procuring samples from below the ground water level, where possible, special type of sampler shall be used. Where Standard Penetration Test is conducted, representative samples shall be obtained from the split spoon. While collecting disturbed samples from borrow areas it shall be ensured that the samples collected represent all types of borrow materials to be used in the construction of embankment and subgrade.\n\n# 2409.2.2\n\nThe size of sample generally required shall be as given in Table 2400-2.",

Where these have to be deposited and there is a possibility of overturning, the crate shall be divided into 1.5 m compartments by cross netting.\n\nFor deep or inaccessible situations, wire crates can be made smaller subject to the approval of the Engineer.\n\nWire crates built in-situ, shall not be larger than 7.5 m x 3 m x 0.6 m, nor smaller than 2 m x 1 m x 0.3 m. Sides of large crates shall be securely stayed at intervals of not more than 1.50 m to prevent bulging.\n\nThe netting shall be made by fixing a row of spikes on a beam at a spacing equal to the mesh. The beam must be a little longer than the width of netting required. The wire is to be cut to lengths about three times the length of the net required. Each piece shall be bent at the middle around one of the spikes and the weaving commenced from the corner.\n\nA double twist shall be given at each intersection. The twisting shall be carefully done by means of a strong iron bar, five and half turns being given to the bar at each splice.\n\nThe bottom and two ends of the crate or mattress shall be made at one time. The other two sides shall be made separately and shall be secured to the bottom and the ends by twisting adjacent wires together. The top shall be made separately and shall be fixed in the same manner as the sides after the crates or mattress have been filled.\n\n# 2503.3.3 laying of Wire Crates\n\nWherever possible, crates shall be placed in position before filling with boulders. Undulations in the bed shall be levelled prior to placement of wire crate units.

To provide a coherent reinforced soil mass, the vertical spacing of primary reinforcement shall not exceed 800 mm, in all types of reinforcement.\n2. For walls constructed with modular blocks and deriving their connection capacity by friction, and also for any other facia configurations, where connection capacity is by friction, the maximum vertical spacing of reinforcement shall be two times the block width (measured from front fact to back face of the block). Further, the maximum spacing of reinforcing elements shall not exceed 800 mm in all cases. The maximum height of facing left unreinforced a) above the uppermost reinforcing layer and b) below the lowest reinforcing layer, shall not exceed the width of the block (measured from the front face to back face of the block.)\n3. In case modular blocks are used for facia, no more than one intervening block shall be left without having primary reinforcement.\n4. In case of wraparound facings for walls, the maximum spacing of reinforcing elements shall not exceed 500 mm, to protect against bulging.\n5. Where panels are used, the maximum spacing of reinforcement shall not exceed 800 mm. The spacing of nearest reinforcing element shall be such that maximum height of facing above uppermost reinforcement layer and below the lower most reinforcement layer does not exceed 400 mm.\n6. Reinforcement spacings worked out from the design procedures shall be configured to fit the above parameters.\n\n# A2-1.2\n\nWhereas the role of the primary reinforcement is to carry the tensile forces in the reinforced fill, secondary reinforcement may be required to protect the slope face from local sloughing and instability depending upon the facia configuration adopted. Where secondary reinforcement is used, stability of the area near the slope face shall be checked separately.\n\nWhere metallic type facia elements are used, the lower part of the facia element may be extended into the fill to serve as a secondary reinforcement. In other types of facia, geogrids may also be used as a secondary reinforcement. The length of the secondary reinforcement shall be adequate to provide local stability in the vicinity of the slope face.\n\n# A3\n\n# REINFORCED SOIL SLOPES\n\n# A3-1.1\n\nReinforced soil slopes are used in a wide variety of situations, such as\n\n- Construction of new embankments\n- Widening of existing slopes.\n- To construct a reinforced slope above a reinforced soil wall.\n\n815",

The design is mainly based on rotational stability analysis.\n\nSteep slopes require a suitable facing to hold the reinforcement in-place as well as to protect the slope from local instability adjacent to the face. In the case of flatter slopes also, facing may be called for. Depending upon the properties of the fill and local climatic conditions of the area, suitable slope protection measures need to be adopted.\n\nWhere wrap around facia, gabion facia, woven and welded wire mesh facia are used suitable batter needs to be given. This batter may also be achieved by means of providing stepped offsets in placing the facia elements.\n\n# A3-1.2 Facia\n\nFacing shall enable the construction within specified tolerances of vertical and horizontal alignment and it should perform over the design life. The facing system should be able to meet the functional requirements such as rigidity, flexibility, aesthetics, environmental considerations etc. depending on location, purpose and use of structure.\n\nFor reinforced soil slopes of permanent nature, the durability of basic material for facing shall be ensured. A suitable filter should be provided behind the woven or welded steel wire mesh elements when they are provided in wrap around form. For steeper slopes in high rainfall intensity and/or high seismicity areas, combination of woven and welded steel wire mesh elements with additional stiffening elements and filter cloth shall be used to achieve flexibility, erosion prevention and stiffness requirements.\n\nWhere geosynthetics are used as facing for permanent reinforced slope structures, outer facia elements are required to be protected against UV degradation from sunlight. When vegetation is used as the facia cover, the face should provide a suitable medium like coir or jute for the establishment and continued growth of vegetation. For a vegetated face, several interrelated aspects need to be considered, including the climate, water requirements of plants and water availability, site location aspect, altitude, amount and frequency of precipitation, exposure, form of facing and erosion resistance capability to ensure permanent vegetative covering throughout the design life. If the characteristics of back fill soil are not adequate to support vegetation, suitable top soil material may be placed at the front face separated from the fill by an appropriate separator.\n\nThe contractor shall provide facing for the reinforced soil slope as approved by the designer and shown in the drawing plan.\n\n816",

Grouted nails are recommended for all types of soil nail walls applications; and in particular, for walls with vertical height more than 7 m. Driven nails shall only be used when wall heights are smaller (less than or up to 7.0 m). The major difference between the two is the pullout resistance of the soil nails and grouted soil nails are expected to have higher pull out resistance. Pull out test is desirable to check the values of pullout resistance which is useful in soil nail design.\n\n# 3202.2\n\nDrilled and grouted soil nails (or simply grouted nails), are approximately 75 mm to 200 mm diameter nail holes drilled in the soil mass to be retained, which shall be followed by placing of steel reinforcement bars (tendon) and the grouting of the drill hole.\n\n# 3202.3\n\nDriven soil nails are relatively small in diameter (20 mm to 25 mm) and are mechanically driven into the ground. They are usually spaced approximately 0.5 m to 1.0 m apart.\n\n# 3203 CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS\n\nFollowing covers the general materials required for the construction of typical soil nailing structure.\n\n# 3203.1 Reinforcement Bar (Nail or Tendon)\n\nThe reinforcing element (tendon) shall be high strength steel reinforcing bar conforming to IS:1786 with a characteristic tensile strength of 415 MPa or higher which may be threaded at one end. Minimum recommended diameter of reinforcement bar (tendon) is 16 mm.\n\n# 3203.2 Nail head\n\nThe nail head shall comprise of following main components: the bearing-plate, hex nut, and washers; and the headed-stud. The bearing plate with a central hole (with diameter greater than reinforcement bar) shall be of minimum Fe250 grade steel, typically square in shape with 200 to 250 mm side dimension and 19 mm thickness. Washers and nuts shall be made of steel with a grade consistent with that of the nail bar commonly of 415 MPa or higher. Nuts may be tightened with a hand-wrench. The headed-stud connection may consist of four headed studs welded near the four corners of the bearing plate to provide anchorage of the\n\n821",

For temporary walls, the bearing plate shall be on the outside face of the shotcrete facing.\n\n# 3203.3 Grout\n\nGrout for soil nails is required to fill the annular space between the nail bar and the surrounding ground, and for shotcreting of the temporary facing. Grout for soil nail walls is commonly a neat cement grout with the water/cement ratio typically ranging from 0.4 to 0.5. Grout mix shall be prepared in accordance with IS:9012. Grout shall have a minimum 28 days characteristic strength of 20 MPa. For filling up nail holes, grout shall be pumped shortly after the nail bar is placed in the drillhole to reduce the potential for hole squeezing or caving. In solid nail bar applications, the grout may be injected by tremie methods through a grout pipe, which is previously inserted to the bottom of the drillhole, until the grout completely fills the drillhole.\n\n# 3203.4 Centralizers\n\nCentralizers are devices made of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) or other synthetic materials that are installed at various locations along the length of each nail bar to ensure that a minimum thickness of grout completely covers the nail bar. Centralizers shall be installed at regular intervals, typically not exceeding 2.5 m, along the length of the nail and at a distance of about 0.5 m from each end of the nail.\n\n# 3204 FACING TYPES\n\nSoil nail walls are generally provided with two types of facings: (a) temporary facing and (b) permanent facing.\n\n# 3204.1 Temporary Facing\n\nTemporary facing shall be constructed by providing reinforcement in the form of welded wire mesh (conforming to IS:1566) throughout the wall face, and by additional bearing plates (see Clause 3203.2.) and waler bars (rebars of smaller lengths placed in the vicinity of nail head) at the nail heads; which is, subsequently shotcreted in accordance with IS:9012. Overall temporary facing thickness shall vary from 75 mm to 200 mm.\n\n# 3204.2 Permanent Facing\n\nPermanent facing may be constructed as cast-in-place reinforced cement concrete conforming to IS:456, precast concrete or any suitable material to achieve desired strength and aesthetics. Reinforcement in the permanent facing may be adopted in the form of welded wire mesh or reinforcement bars in either direction. Permanent facing shall be connected to the temporary facing by means of headed-studs (usually four numbers per plate) welded on the bearing plates installed during construction temporary facing. Minimum thickness of permanent facing shall not be less than 200 mm.\n\n822",

Borings behind the wall should be located within a distance up to 1 to 1.5 times the height of the wall behind the wall and should be spaced up to 45 m along the wall alignment. Borings in front of the wall should be located within a distance up to 0.75 times the wall height in front of the wall and should be spaced up to 60 m along the wall alignment. The depth of borings should extend at least one full wall height below the bottom of the excavation.\n\n# 3206.2 Bond Strength\n\nThe bond strength is the mobilized shear resistance along the soil-grout interface. The bond strength adopted for the design of soil nails is commonly based on conservative estimates obtained from field correlation studies and local experience in similar conditions. Consequently, some percentage of the soil nails shall be load tested according to standard procedure (pullout tests) in the field to verify bond strength design.\n\n# 3206.3 Suitable In-Situ Ground Conditions\n\nFollowing are the in-situ conditions considered favorable for the prospective use of soil nailing technique.\n\n- Soil shall be able to stand unsupported to a depth of about 1 m \u2013 2 m high vertical or nearly vertical cut for 12-24 hours.\n\n                                             823",

For rigorous analyses, use of computational tools based on advanced numerical techniques such as finite element method, is strongly recommended.\n\n# 3208 INITIAL DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS\n\n# 3208.1 Wall layout\n\nEstablish the layout of the soil nail wall, including: (1) wall height; (2) length of the wall; (3) backslope; and (4) wall face batter. Wall face batter typically ranges from 0\u00ba to 10\u00ba. The evaluation of the wall layout also includes developing longitudinal profile of the wall, locating wall appurtenances (e.g., traffic barriers, utilities, and drainage systems), and establishing ROW limitations.\n\n# 3208.2 Soil Nail Vertical and Horizontal Spacing\n\nTypically, same nail spacing can be adopted in both horizontal S\u2095 and vertical Sv directions. Nail spacing ranges from 1.25 to 2 m (commonly 1.5 m) for conventional drilled and grouted soil nails, and as low as 0.4 m for driven nails. As a general rule, soil nail spacing in horizontal and vertical direction must be such that each nail has an influence area S\u2095 \u00d7 Sv \u2264 4m\u00b2.\n\n# 3208.3 Soil Nail Pattern on Wall Face\n\nThe soil nail pattern on wall face may be adopted as one of the following: (1) square (or rectangular); (2) staggered in a triangular pattern; and (3) irregular (at limited locations) depending upon the ease of construction and site-specific constraints.\n\n# 3208.4 Soil Nail Inclination\n\nSoil nails are typically installed at an inclination ranging from 0 to 30 degrees from horizontal with a typical inclination of 10-25 degrees.\n\n824",

            "text": "Soil Nailing\n\n# 3208.5 Soil Nail Length and Distribution\n\nThe distribution of soil nail lengths in a soil nail wall can be selected as either uniform (i.e., only one nail length is used for the entire wall), or variable, where different nail lengths may be used for individual soil nail levels within a wall cross section. Uniform nail pattern is recommended for most applications.\n\n# 3209 OTHER DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS\n\n# 3209.1 Loads and Load Combinations\n\nSoil nail walls used on typical highway projects are typically subjected to the following different loads during their service life: (i) Dead loads DL (e.g., weight of the soil nail wall system, lateral earth pressure, weight of a nearby above-ground structure); (ii) Live loads LL (e.g., traffic loads); (iii) impact loads IL (e.g., vehicle collision on barriers above soil nail wall); and (iv) earthquake loads EQ. Following load combinations are recommended to assess the most critical loading condition:\n\n- (a) DL + LL\n- (b) DL + LL + IL\n- (c) DL + EQ\n\nFor earthquake loads, allowable stresses shall be increased by 133 percent from the values obtained with factors of safety for static loads.\n\n# 3209.2 Permissible Soil Nail Wall Deformations\n\nThe maximum permissible lateral deformation at the top of the soil nail walls constructed in weathered rock and stiff soils is 0.1%H; sandy soils is 0.2%H and for fine-grained soils is 0.3%H. Under no circumstances maximum permissible lateral deformation shall exceed 0.3%H, where: H is the vertical height of the soil nail wall. Permissible vertical deformation (i.e., settlement) shall be considered to be same as the permissible horizontal deformation.\n\n# 3209.3 Drainage Measures\n\n# 3209.3.1 Short Term Drainage Measures\n\nSurface water and groundwater must be controlled both during and after construction of the soil nail wall. A surface water interceptor ditch, excavated along the crest of the excavation and lined with concrete, is a recommended element for controlling surface water flows. Additionally, if ground water impacts are temporary or localized, suitable dewatering measures may be taken for lowering the groundwater table:\n\n825\n\n",

Specify a minimum grout cover of 25 mm between the reinforcement nail bar and the soil;\n2. recommend epoxy coating of minimum thickness 0.4 mm on the nail bars shall be applied by the manufacturer prior to shipment of nails to the construction site, which is, subsequently to be encased in grout cover;\n3. adopt other site-specific suitable corrosion protection measures.\n\n# 3210 FIELD PULLOUT TESTING\n\n# 3210.1\n\nField pullout testing of soil nails shall be conducted (a) to verify that the nail design loads can be carried without excessive movements and with an adequate safety factor for the service life of the structure, and (b) to verify the adequacy of the contractor\u2019s drilling, installation, and grouting operations prior to and during construction of production soil nails.\n\n# 3210.2 Types of Field Pullout Tests\n\nDepending upon the type of test being performed, the maximum test load, the load increments, and the time that each load increment is held shall be determined. To prevent chances of explosive failure of the steel, in no case, the soil nail tendon be stressed to more than 80 percent of its minimum ultimate tensile strength for grade Fe415 steel, or more than 90 percent of the minimum yield strength for grade Fe500 steel.\n\n826",

Verification tests are generally conducted on non-production \u201csacrificial\u201d nails as a first order of work prior to construction.\n\n# 3210.2.2 Proof Test\n\nA proof test is typically performed on a specified number of the total number of production soil nails installed. Typically, successful proof tests shall be performed on 5 percent of the production nails in each row or a minimum of 1 test per row. Proof tests provide information necessary to evaluate the ability of production soil nails to safely withstand design loads without excessive structural movement or long-term creep over the structure\u2019s service life.\n\n# 3210.2.3 Creep Test\n\nCreep tests are generally performed as part of a verification or proof test to ensure that nail design loads can be safely carried throughout the structure service life.\n\n# 3211 MEASUREMENT FOR PAYMENT\n\nMeasurements for earthwork shall conform to IS:1200(Part I), concrete work shall conform to IS:1200(Part II) and steelworks shall conform to IS:1200(Part VIII).

A sample of pulverised soil approximately 1kg in weight should be taken and weighed (W\u2081).\n2. It should be spread on the sieve and shaken gently, care being taken to break the lumps of soils as little as possible. Weight of soil retained on the sieve should be recorded (W\u2082). Lumps of finer soils in the retained material should be broken until all the individual particulars finer than the aperture size of the sieve are separated.\n3. The soil should again be placed on the sieve and shaken until sieving is complete. The retained material should be weighed (W\u2083).\n4. Weight of soil by percent passing the sieve can then be calculated from the expression:\n\n(W\u2081 \u2212 W\u2082) \u00d7 100\n\n(W\u2081 \u2212 W\u2083)\n\n847",

Scope\n\n1.1 Anti-stripping agents are used for bituminous materials and mixes to ensure adhesion between aggregates (hydrophilic in nature) and bitumen, even under submergence in water. Prior approval of the Engineer shall be taken in respect of both qualitative and quantitative use of a particular product.\n\n# 2. Materials\n\n2.1 The anti-stripping agents shall be fatty acid amines having a long hydrocarbon chain.\n\n2.2 Physical and Chemical Requirements: The anti-stripping agents shall conform to the physical and chemical requirements as detailed in Table A4-1.\n\n2.3 Storage and Handling: Anti-stripping agents shall be properly stored in closed containers made of steel or aluminium. Containers made of zinc, copper, polythene, PVC and most types of rubber are not suitable for use. As most of the anti-stripping agents cause irritation when in contact with human skin and are also irritating to the eyes, protective gloves for hands and goggles for the eyes shall be used while handling them, specially in case of liquid anti-stripping agents.\n\n# 3. Use in Sprayed Work\n\n3.1 Additive dosage: The dosage shall be determined depending on the nature (stripping value) of the aggregate and the size of aggregate. While the recommended minimum dose of anti-stripping agent for sprayed work is given in Table A4-2, the actual dosage shall be determined in the laboratory as directed by the Engineer.\n\n3.2 Mixing procedure during construction: The anti-stripping agent supplied in liquid, solid or concentrate form shall be thoroughly mixed with liquid bituminous material or with straight run bitumen. When used with straight run bitumen, the correct dose of anti-stripping agent shall be mixed in a hot bitumen tank boiler. The two constituents shall be agitated till the anti-stripping agent is thoroughly mixed. The dose of anti-stripping agent shall suitably be increased if the binder is to remain in bitumen boiler for a longer period.\n\n# 4. Use in Premix Work\n\n4.1 Additive dosage: The dosage shall be determined depending on the nature (stripping value) of the aggregate and the percent voids in the mix. While the recommended minimum doses for different types of bituminous premix materials in terms of voids content are given in Table A4-3, the actual dosage shall be determined in the laboratory as directed by the Engineer.\n\n848",

It is necessary to use a stable antistripping agent or increase the dose according to expected degradation. Alternatively, the correct dose shall be injected into the bitumen line by means of a pump. The agent is fed into the bitumen first before it is sprayed on the aggregate in the mix; thus, no separate mixing time for mixing the agent with bitumen is required. In rolled asphalt and bitumen mastic surfacing works, precoated chippings are pressed into the hard surface while the mix is still hot to make the newly laid surface skid resistant. These chippings shall be precoated with bitumen treated with antistripping compound.\n\n# Table A4-3 Tentative Recommended Minimum dose of Antistripping compound in Bitumen premix Works\n\n| stripping value of aggregate | dose of antistripping agent in percent by weight of bitumen |                             |     |\n| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- | --- |\n| voids content 3-5 percent    | voids content 5-10 percent                                  | voids content 10-15 percent |     |\n| 0-25                         | 0.3                                                         | 0.4                         | 0.5 |\n| 25-50                        | 0.4                                                         | 0.5                         | 0.6 |\n| 50-100                       | 0.6                                                         | 0.8                         | 1.0 |\n\n850",

The cylinder along with its contents shall be kept in a water bath, maintained at 50\u00ba + 1\u00baC for half an hour. It shall then be taken out from the water bath and shaken vigorously for 10 minutes. The stopper shall be removed and the cylinder kept in the water bath for half an hour and examined for separation or settlement.\n\nReporting of Results: An antistripping agent is reported to be completely soluble in diesel oil if no separation or settlement is observed for half an hour.\n\n# Testing Stripping Value of Aggregates Using Bitumen with Varying Percentages of Antistripping Agent\n\nProcedure: Coarse aggregate passing 19 mm sieve and retained on 13.2 mm sieve shall be washed and dried in an oven for 24 hours at 110\u00baC. Such dried 200 gms of coarse aggregates shall be heated at 149\u00baC and then mixed with 80/100 penetration grade bitumen 5 percent by weight of coarse aggregate heated up to 163\u00baC. The mixture shall be mixed thoroughly for uniform coating of aggregates by bitumen. The mix shall then be transferred to a 500 ml beaker and allowed to cool to room temperature. Distilled water shall be added in the beaker, which shall be placed in a water bath maintained at 40\u00ba \u00b1 1\u00baC for 24 hours. The percentage degree of stripping shall be assessed visually. The test shall also be conducted with water containing 1 percent Sodium Chloride, as a precautionary measure to eliminate water contamination. The test is repeated using bitumen containing up to one percent of antistripping agent in stages of 0.25 percent.\n\n# Testing Efficacy of Antistripping Agent to Coat Aggregates with Bitumen in Presence of Water\n\nProcedure: The antistripping agent shall be added in percent contents of 0.0, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1.00 and 1.25 to cutback bitumen MC3 (4 parts of bitumen 80/100 and 1 part of kerosene oil). The blends shall be used for testing their ability to coat the road aggregates under water.\n\n(a) 100 gm of clean and dry stone dust conforming to the following gradation shall be taken:\n\n| sieve size | percent passing |\n| ---------- | --------------- |\n| 2.36 mm    | 100             |\n| 1.18 mm    | 80              |\n\n851",

The bitumen-antistripping agent blend shall be added in the bottle at the rate of 7.5 percent by weight of stone dust. The stopper shall be replaced and the bottle shall be vigorously shaken for two minutes. The water shall be then drained off and the stone dust shall be transferred to a piece of paper and examined visually for satisfying complete coating. The minimum percent content of antistripping agent at which the stone dust sample is thoroughly coated shall be recorded. The test shall be repeated at 60\u00baC in water as well as 1 percent solution of Sodium Chloride in water for both the testing temperatures.\n\n(b) The underwater coating test further be conducted with coarse aggregate, passing 19 mm sieve and retained on 13.2 mm sieve. In this case, the percent content of the cutback-antistripping agent blend shall be kept at 5 percent by weight of coarse aggregate. In order to take care of contamination in water, the test shall also be carried out in the 1 percent Sodium Chloride in water.\n\nThe minimum percent content of antistripping agent at which stone dust/coarse aggregate is thoroughly coated as per (a) and (b) shall be taken as the dose of antistripping agent.\n\n# Testing for Thermal Stability of Antistripping Agent\n\nProcedure: Blends of antistripping agent and bitumen of 80/100 grade shall be prepared with 0.00, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75 and 1.00 percent contents of antistripping agent and kept in oven at 163\u00baC for five hours. After the heat exposure, the blend samples are fluxed with kerosene oil to obtain the consistency of MC 3 and tested for underwater coating test.\n\nReporting of Test Results: An antistripping agent shall be deemed to be heat resistant if the dose requirement before and after heat exposure remains unchanged.\n\n# Quantitative Evaluation of Retained Marshall Stability Values After Immersion in Water\n\nProcedure: For Quantitative evaluation, the tests shall be carried out as stipulated in ASTM D1075 (Effect of Water on Cohesion of Compacted Bituminous Mixtures).

If additional/new joints are approved by the Engineer, the following considerations for their location shall be taken into account:\n\n- Joints shall be provided in non-aggressive zones or in non-splash zones. If not feasible, the joints shall be sealed.\n- Joints should be positioned where they are readily accessible for preparation and concreting, such as location where the cross-section is relatively small, and where reinforcement is not congested.\n- In beams and slabs, joints should not be near the supports. Construction joints between slabs and ribs in composite beams should be avoided.\n- For box girders, it is preferable to cast the soffit and the webs without any joint.\n- Location of joints shall minimize the effects of the discontinuity on the durability, structural integrity and the appearance of the structure.\n\n# Preparation of Surface of the Joint\n\nLaitance shall be removed before fresh concrete is cast. The surface shall be roughened. Care shall be taken that they should not dislodge the coarse aggregates. Concrete may be brushed with a stiff brush soon after casting while the concrete is still fresh.\n\nIf the concrete has partially hardened, it shall be treated by wire brushing or with a stiff water jet followed by drying with air jet immediately.\n\nFully hardened concrete shall be treated with mechanical hand tools or grit blasting, taking care not to split or crack aggregate particles.\n\nBefore further concrete is cast, the surface should be thoroughly cleaned to remove debris and accumulated rubbish, one effective method being by air jet.\n\nWhere there is likely to be a delay before placing the next concrete lift, protruding reinforcement shall be protected. Before the next lift is placed, rust, loose mortar or other contamination shall be removed from the reinforcements. In aggressive environment, the concrete shall be cut back to expose the reinforcements for a length of about 50 mm to ensure that contaminated concrete is removed.\n\n861",

At least 3 samples for one lot of supply (not exceeding 7000 metre length) shall be tested. The tests are applicable for sheathing transported to site in straight lengths when the prestressing cable is threaded inside the sheathing prior to concreting. These tests are not applicable for sheathing not for coiled cable and transported to site as an assembled unit, nor for sheathing ducts placed in position without threading of prestressing cable prior to concreting.\n\n# (A) Workability Test\n\nA test sample 1100 mm long is soldered to a fixed base plate with a soft solder (Fig.1800/i-1). The sample is then bent to a radius of 1800 mm alternately on either side to complete 3 cycles. Thereafter, the sealing joints will be visually inspected to verify that no failure/opening has taken place.\n\n# (B) Transverse Load Rating Test\n\nThe test ensures that stiffness of the sheathing is sufficient to prevent permanent distortion during site handling. The sample is placed on a horizontal support 500 mm long so that the sample is supported at all points of outward corrugations. A load as specified in Table 1 is applied gradually at the centre of the supported portion through a contact surface 12 mm long. It shall be ensured that the load is applied approximately at the centre of two corrugations, Fig. 1800/i-2. The load as specified is applied in increments.\n\n| Dia  | 25 mm To 35 mm | more than 35 mm up to 45 mm | more than 45 mm up to 55 mm | more than 55 mm up to 65 mm | more than 65 mm up to 75 mm | more than 75 mm up to 85 mm | more than 85 mm |\n| ---- | -------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------- | --------------- |\n| Load | 250 N          | 400 N                       | 500 N                       | 600 N                       | 700 N                       | 800 N                       | 1000 N          |\n\nThe sample is considered acceptable if the permanent deformation is less than 5 percent.\n\n864",

This also covers some of the essential protective measures to be adopted for minimising corrosion in PSC bridges.\n\n1.2 The purpose of grouting is to provide permanent protection to the post-tensioned steel against corrosion and to develop bond between the prestressing steel and the surrounding structural concrete. The grout ensures encasement of steel in an alkaline environment for corrosion protection and by filling the duct space, it prevents water collection and freezing.\n\n# 2 MATeRiALs\n\n2.1 Water\nOnly clean potable water free from impurities conforming to section 1000 shall be permitted. No sea or creek water is to be used at all.\n\n2.2 cement\nOrdinary Portland cement should be used for preparation of the grout. It should be as fresh as possible and free of any lumps. Pozzolana cement shall not be used.\n\n2.3 sand\nIt is not recommended to use sand for grouting of prestressing tendons. In case the internal diameter of the ducts exceeds 150 mm, use of sand may be considered. Sand used, shall conform to IS:383 and shall pass through IS Sieve No. 150. The weight of sand in the grout shall not be more than 10 percent of the weight of cement, unless proper workability can be ensured by addition of suitable plasticizers.\n\n2.4 Admixtures\nAcceptable admixtures conforming to IS:9102 may be used if tests have shown that their use improves the properties of grout, i.e. increasing fluidity, reducing bleeding, entraining air or expanding the grout.

For this purpose special openings should be provided where such openings are not available at end anchorages. For draped (curved) cables vents shall be provided at all crown and valley points. It is a good practice to provide additional air vents at suitable intervals not exceeding 20 m.

The joints of the couplers and the sheathing should be made waterproof by use of adhesive tape or similar suitable system capable of giving leak proof joints. Grout openings and vents must be securely anchored to the duct and to either forms or to reinforcing steel to prevent displacement during concreting operations due to weight, buoyancy and vibrations.\n\n# 2.5.4 Ducts require very careful handling\n\nAs, being of thin metal, they are susceptible to leakage due to corrosion in transit or storage, by tearing/ripping in handling particularly when placed adjoining to reinforcing steel, by pulling apart at joints while inserting tendons prior to concreting, or by accidental puncturing while drilling for form ties/inserts. Ducts are also liable to damage by rough use of internal vibrator and sparks from welding being done close by.\n\n# 3 Equipment\n\n# 3.1 Grout Mixer and Agitator\n\nIt is essential that the grout is maintained in a homogeneous state and of uniform consistency so that there is no separation of cement.

The grout pump must be fitted with a pressure gauge to enable pressure of injection to be controlled. The minimum pressure at which grout should be pumped shall be 0.3 MPa and the Grout Pump must have a relief arrangement for bypass of the grout in case of buried up of pressure beyond 1 MPA. The capacity of the grout pump should be such as to achieve forward speed of grout of around 5 to 10 metres per minute. The slower rates are preferable as they reduce the possibility of occurrence of voids. If the capacity of the pump is large, it is usual to grout two or more cables simultaneously through a common manifold.\n\nUse of hand pumps for grouting is not recommended. Use of compressed air operated equipment for injection is prohibited, as it is likely that there will be some air trapped in grout.\n\n# 3.3 Water pump\n\nBefore commencement of grouting, a stand by direct feed high pressure water pump should be available at site for an emergency. In case of any problem in grouting the ducts, such pump shall immediately be connected to the duct and all grout flushed by use of high pressure water flushing. It is, therefore, necessary to have adequate storage of clean potable water for operation of the water pump for such emergencies.\n\n# 3.4 grout screen\n\nThe grouting equipment should contain a screen having a mesh size of IS:106 (IS:105 if sand is used). Prior to introduction into the grout pump, the grout should be passed through such screen. This screen should be easily accessible for inspection and cleaning.\n\n# 3.5 connections and Air vents\n\nStandard details of fixing inlets, outlets and air vents to the sheathing and/or anchorage should be followed as recommended by specialist supplier of the system of prestressing.

The constituent may contain chlorides/sulphates. However, its net effect should not exceed the following limits in the grout:\n\n- Chlorides (Cl) not more than 0.1 percent by weight of cement.\n- Sulphate (SO\u2083) not more than 4 percent by weight of cement.\n- Sulphide-ions(s) not more than 0.01 percent by weight of cement.\n2. compressive strength\nThe compressive strength of 100 mm cube of the grout shall not be less than 27 MPa at 7 days or 30 MPa at 28 days.

The final setting time shall not be less than 24 hours.\n4. Bleeding\nBleeding is the separation of free water from the grout mix. It includes the filtering effect of strands where the cavities between the wires constituting the strand, block cement particles and permit water under pressure to move ahead of the grout in the direction of general flow of grout. The bleeding shall be sufficiently low to prevent excessive segregation and sediment of the grout material. The bleeding shall not exceed 0.3 percent of volume of the initial volume of grout after three hours kept at rest.\n5. volume change\nThe volume change of grout kept at rest for 24 hours and tested as per ASTM C 1090 shall be within range of 1% and 5 % of the original volume.\n\n876",

Water used for flushing should be of same quality as used for grouting. It may, however, contain about 1 percent of slaked lime or quick lime. All water should be drained thorough the lowest vent pipe or by blowing compressed air through the duct.\n\nv) The water in the duct should be blown out with oil free compressed air. Blowing out water from duct for cables longer than 50 m draped up at both ends by compressed air is not effective. Outlet/ vent provided at or near the lowest point shall be used to drain out water from duct.\n\nvi) The connection between the nozzle of the injection pipe and duct should be such that air cannot be sucked in.\n\nvii) All outlet points including vent openings should be kept open prior to commencement of injection grout.\n\nviii) Before grouting, all air in the pump and hose should be expelled. The suction circuit of the pump should be air-tight.\n\n# 6.2 Injection of Grout\n\n- a) After mixing the grout should be kept in continuous movement.\n- b) Injection of grout must be continuous and should not be interrupted.\n- c) For vertical cable or cables inclined more than 60 degrees to the horizontal, injection should be effected from the lowest anchorage or vent of the duct.\n- d) The method of injection should ensure complete filling of the ducts. To verify this it is advisable to compare the volume of the space to be filled by the injected grout with the quantity of grout actually injected.\n- e) Grouting should be commenced initially with a low pressure of injection of up to 0.3 MPa increasing it until the grout comes out at the other end. The grout should be allowed to flow freely from the other end until the consistency of the grout at this end is the same as that of the grout at the injection end. When the grout flows at the other end, it should be closed off and building up of pressure commenced. Full injection pressure at about 0.5 MPa shall be maintained for at least one minute before closing the injection pipe. It is recommended practice to provide a stand pipe at the highest point of the tendon profile to hold all water displaced by sedimentation or bleeding. If there is a built up of pressure much in excess of 1 MPa without flow of grout coming at the other end; the grouting operation should be discontinued and the entire duct flushed with high pressure water. Also, the bypass system indicated in para 3.2 above is essential for further safety.\n\n878",

If frost is likely to occur within 48 hours after injection, heat must be applied to the member and maintained for at least 48 hours after injection so that the temperature of the grout does not fall below 5 degrees Celsius. Prior to commencement of grouting, care must be taken to ensure that the duct is completely free of frost/ice by flushing with warm water, but not with steam.\n\nb) The temperature of the grout shall not exceed 25 degrees Celsius. For increasing the workability of grout, its temperature may be lowered by use of chilled water or by putting ice outside the grout storage container.\n\nc) When the cables are threaded after concreting, the duct must be temporarily stiffened during concreting by inserting bunch of strands, wires or reinforcement or a rigid PVC pipe or any other suitable method.\n\nd) During concreting, care shall be taken to ensure that the sheathing is not damaged. Needle vibrators shall be used with extreme care by well experienced staff only, to ensure against such damage.\n\ne) It is a good practice to move the cables in both directions during the concreting operations. This can easily be done by light hammering the ends of the wires/strands during concreting. It is also advisable that 3 to 4 hours after concreting the cable should be moved both ways through a distance of about 20 cms. With such movement, any leakage of mortar which has taken place in spite of all precautions, loses bond with the cables, thus reducing the chance of blockages. This operation can also be done by fixing prestressing jacks, at one end pulling the entire cable and then repeating the operation by fixing the jack at the other end.\n\nf) The cables to be grouted should be separated by as much distance as possible.\n\n879",
