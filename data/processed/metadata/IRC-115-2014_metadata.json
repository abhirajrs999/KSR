The working principle of a typical FWD is illustrated in Fig. 1. DO, D1, etc., mentioned in Fig. 1 are surface deflections measured at different radial distances. Impulse load is applied by means of a falling mass, which is allowed to drop vertically on a system of springs placed over a circular loading plate. The deflected shape of the pavement surface is measured using displacement sensors which are placed at different radial distances starting from the center of the load plate. Trailer mounted as well as vehicle mounted FWD models are available commercially. The working principle of these models essentially is the same. A mass of weights is dropped from a pre-determined height onto a series of springs/buffers placed on top of a loading plate. The corresponding peak load and peak vertical surface deflections at different radial locations are measured and recorded.",

    "4: 1 Falling Weight Deflectometer (FWD) is an impulse-loading device which applies a transient load to the pavement and the deflected shape of the pavement surface is measured. The working principle of a typical FWD is illustrated in Fig. 1. DO, D1, etc., mentioned in Fig. 1 are surface deflections measured at different radial distances. Impulse load is applied by means of a falling mass, which is allowed to drop vertically on a system of springs placed over a circular loading plate. The deflected shape of the pavement surface is measured using displacement sensors which are placed at different radial distances starting from the center of the load plate. Trailer mounted as well as vehicle mounted FWD models are available commercially. The working principle of these models essentially is the same. A mass of weights is dropped from a pre-determined height onto a series of springs/buffers placed on top of a loading plate. The corresponding peak load and peak vertical surface deflections at different radial locations are measured and recorded.",

    "111: 1 A number of softwares such as ELMOD, EVERCALC, BISDEF, NUS-BACK, MICH-BACK, MODULUS, PADAL, etc. are available for the backcalculation of pavement layer moduli from deflections measured using FWD. Some of these models use regression techniques for estimation of one or more moduli. Most of the traditional methods follow iterative approaches which vary the moduli in each step and compare the computed and measured deflections. The iterations continue till satisfactory matching between the known and computed deflections is attained. The methods differ mostly in the techniques used for successive selection of new set of modulus values. Other non-traditional techniques such as artificial neural networks and genetic algorithms have also been used for backcalculation.",
    "111: 2 KGPBACK, a specific version of BACKGA program, which was developed for the research scheme R-81 (2003) of the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, is recommended in these guidelines for backcalculation. KGPBACK is a Genetic Algorithm based model for backcalculation of layer moduli. Because of the features of the search algorithm used in them, Genetic Algorithms (GA) have become popular as an optimization technique that has the ability to solve complex problems. The early use of GAs for backcalculation of pavement layer moduli was with the development of NUS-GABACK program by et al (1997). It was shown that NUS-GABACK performed comparably well against other programs and showed consistency in the accuracy of the solutions. The other GA based backcalculation method reported in literature was the program developed by Kameyama et al (1998) for the backcalculation of moduli of flexible and rigid pavements.",
    "111: 3 GA is a population based search and optimization technique. It maintains a population of individual solutions that compete amongst themselves based on the Darwin's survival of the fittest principle (Deb, 1995; Goldberg, 2000). Each individual solution (called chromosome) in the GA population is a finite length string code corresponding to a solution to the given problem. Each individual has a fitness value associated with it which is some measure of its closeness to the actual solution.",
    "111: 4 The population is initially generated randomly and the fitness of each individual in the population is calculated. Then the genetic operators are repeatedly applied to this population until the desired solution is found or specified number of iterations are over. A typical GA uses three operators: reproduction or selection, crossover and mutation. In reproduction each individual in the population produces offsprings according to its fitness value. Thus, individuals with higher fitness contribute more offsprings in each generation. In crossover operation, two chromosome strings are randomly selected and their portions are exchanged with a probability P^ to form new individual. The crossover point about which the strings are exchanged is also selected randomly. In mutation operation, each bit in the string is flipped according to the probability P^, which is usually very small.",
