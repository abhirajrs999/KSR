These guidelines were revised in 1984 considering the design traffic in terms of cumulative number of equivalent standard axle load of 80 kN and design charts were provided for design traffic volumes up to 30 million standard axle (msa) repetitions. The 1970 and 1984 versions of the guidelines were based on empirical (experience based) approach.",

The mechanistic-empirical performance models for subgrade rutting and bottom-up cracking in the bottom bituminous layer, developed using the results of these research schemes, were used for the design of flexible pavements. FPAVE software, developed for R-56 research scheme for the analysis of linear elastic layered pavement systems, was used for the analysis of pavements and for the development of thickness design charts. Thickness charts were provided for design traffic levels up to 150 msa.",

Recommendations were made for the use of harder grade binders to resist rutting and top-down cracking in the upper bituminous layer and for fatigue resistant bituminous mixes for the bottom bituminous layer. Mechanistic-empirical performance models were given for rutting in subgrade and bottom-up cracking in bituminous layers for two different levels (80% and 90%) of reliability. Fatigue criteria were included for cement treated bases also.",

    "1: 1 The first guidelines for the design of flexible pavements, published in 1970, were based on (i) subgrade (foundation) strength (California Bearing Ratio) and (ii) traffic, in terms of number of commercial vehicles (having a laden weight of 3 tonnes or more) per day. These guidelines were revised in 1984 considering the design traffic in terms of cumulative number of equivalent standard axle load of 80 kN and design charts were provided for design traffic volumes up to 30 million standard axle (msa) repetitions. The 1970 and 1984 versions of the guidelines were based on empirical (experience based) approach.",
    "1: 2 The second revision was carried out in 2001 [1] using semi-mechanistic (or mechanistic-empirical) approach based on the results available from R-6[2], R-56[3] and other research schemes of the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH). The mechanistic-empirical performance models for subgrade rutting and bottom-up cracking in the bottom bituminous layer, developed using the results of these research schemes, were used for the design of flexible pavements. FPAVE software, developed for R-56 research scheme for the analysis of linear elastic layered pavement systems, was used for the analysis of pavements and for the development of thickness design charts. Thickness charts were provided for design traffic levels up to 150 msa.",
    "1: 3 The third revision of the guidelines was carried out in 2012[4] to facilitate (i) design of bituminous pavements for traffic volumes more than 150 msa (ii) utilization of new types of pavement materials such as bituminous mixes with modified binders, foam/emulsion treated granular or Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement (RAP) material bases and sub-bases and cement treated sub-bases and bases and stabilized subgrades and (iii) utilization of new construction techniques/practices. Recommendations were made for the use of harder grade binders to resist rutting and top-down cracking in the upper bituminous layer and for fatigue resistant bituminous mixes for the bottom bituminous layer. Mechanistic-empirical performance models were given for rutting in subgrade and bottom-up cracking in bituminous layers for two different levels (80% and 90%) of reliability. Fatigue criteria were included for cement treated bases also.",
    "1: 4 The fourth (current) revision has been done based on the feedback received on the performance of bituminous pavements in general and that of bituminous layers in particular. Different provisions made in the third revision of the guidelines have been fine-tuned based on the feedback. Some of the salient features of the fourth revision are: (a) recommendation of better performing bituminous mixes and binders for surface and base/binder courses (b) guidelines for selection of appropriate elastic moduli for bituminous mixes used in the surface and other courses (c) recommendation of minimum thicknesses of granular and cement treated sub-bases and bases and bituminous layers from functional requirements (d) generalization of the procedure for the estimation of the effective resilient modulus/CBR of subgrade (e) provision for the use of geo-synthetics and (f) rationalization of the design approach for stage construction.",
    "1: 5 The draft of the basic document was prepared by Late Prof. B.B. Pandey of IITKharagpur based on the feedback received during the open house discussion on IRC:37-2012 held at the",
    "2: 1 The Guidelines shall apply to the design of new flexible pavements and reconstruction of damaged pavements for roads with a design traffic of two million standard axle (msa) load repetitions or more. For the roads with a design traffic of less than 2 msa, IRC:SP:72[5] shall be adopted for pavement design. For rehabilitation of in-service pavements, overlay design shall be done as per Falling Weight Deflectometer (FWD) method (IRC:115)[6] or Benkelman Beam Deflection (BBD) test method (IRC:81)[7].",
    "2: 2 Users of the guidelines are expected to use their skills, experience and engineering judgment and take into consideration the local climatic conditions, cost and availability of materials, their durability and past pavement performance in their respective regions for selecting a suitable pavement composition.",
    "2: 3 The guidelines may require revision from time to time in the light of future performance data and technological developments. Towards this end, it is suggested that all the organizations intending to use the guidelines should keep a detailed record of the year of construction, subgrade CBR, soil characteristics, pavement composition and specifications, traffic, pavement performance, overlay history, climatic conditions, etc., and provide feedback to the Indian Roads Congress for further revision.",
    "3: 1 While various sections of these guidelines describe the design procedures in detail, these are supplemented by a discussion on the ‘principle and approach to design’ given in the Appendix-A to this document, which needs to be considered as an integral part of the Guidelines. The Annexes (I to III) given to this document intend to elaborate the finer points of design and support the recommendations by different worked out design examples to help the users in familiarizing themselves with different provisions of the guidelines and for arriving at a safe, economical and performing design.",

The elastic moduli of subgrade and embankment soils/layers may be estimated from equations 6.1 and 6.2 using their laboratory CBR values. Poisson’s ratio (μ) value may be taken as 0.35 for all the layers.",

    "2: The minimum thickness of the single filter-cum-drainage layer shall be 150 mm from functional requirement.",
    "3: The minimum thickness of any compacted granular layer should preferably be at least 2.5 times the nominal maximum size of aggregates subject to a minimum of 100 mm.",
    "4: The total thickness of the granular sub-base layer should be adequate to carry the construction traffic that may ply on the GSB. This thickness requirement may be worked out to satisfy the subgrade rutting limiting strain criterion given by equation 3.1 or 3.2 (as applicable for the classification of highway and design traffic). The design traffic for this purpose can be worked out based on the expected number of operations of dumpers and other construction vehicles on the GSB layer to carry material for the construction of granular or cement treated base layer. The indicative values of construction traffic loading and the procedure given in the worked out example in Annex-II can be used for the estimation of the construction traffic operating over the granular sub-base if more accurate and practical estimation cannot be done.",
    "5: The sub-base thickness should be checked for the design traffic worked out as per the above mentioned procedure or 10,000 standard axle repetitions, whichever is more.",
    "6: The two-layer system (subgrade and GSB) should be analyzed by placing a standard load over it (dual wheel set of 20,000 N each acting at 0.56 MPa contact pressure) and computing (using IITPAVE) the maximum subgrade vertical compressive strain. The GSB thickness should be varied until the computed strain is less than or equal to the limiting subgrade vertical compressive strain, given by equations 3.1 or 3.2 (as applicable).",

    "13: 1 In areas susceptible to frost action, the design will have to be related to the actual depth of penetration and severity of the frost. At the subgrade level, fine grained clayey and silty soils are more susceptible to ice formation, but freezing conditions could also develop within the pavement structure if water has a chance of ingress from above.",
    "13: 2 One remedy against frost attack is to increase the depth of construction to correspond to the depth of frost penetration, but this may not always be economically practicable. As a general rule, it would not be advisable to provide total pavement thickness less than 450 mm even when the CBR value of the subgrade warrants a smaller thickness. In addition, the materials used for building up the crust should be frost resistant.",
    "13: 3 Another precaution against frost attack is that water should not be allowed to collect at the subgrade level which may happen on account of infiltration through the pavement surface or verges or due to capillary rise from a high water table. Whereas capillary rise can be prevented by subsoil drainage measures and cut-offs, infiltrating surface water can be checked only by providing a suitable surfacing course and a subsurface drainage system.",
